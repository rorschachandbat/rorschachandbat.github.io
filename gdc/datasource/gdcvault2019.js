In response to the scale of this challenge, Ubisoft Reflections has been developing, in the context of 'The Division', \"Client Bots\", an AI that takes control of the player, mimicking human input while also reporting issues (missions incomplete-able, performance statistics etc.). Applications of this technology include automated mission play through and report generation, follow bots that help QC and level designers to test multiplayer missions solo, streets wandering for performance data gathering, a general purpose platform for any bespoke testing and a tool to assist bug reproduction. This session will present the motivations behind the system, citing many of the Ubisoft Reflections team's use cases to give insight into the internal architecture of their client bots, the challenges they faced, and best practices on how to build content to support such a technology."},

With a traditional network model, it would be a nightmare to replicate while keeping the bandwidth consumption low and preserving the precision and fairness of the fight system. In this session, Jennifer Henry (Gameplay Programmer at Ubisoft Montreal) will present the non-authoritative architecture behind the game, a variation on deterministic simulation that uses time travel to not hinder fluidity and responsiveness. But, as every team that commits to new tech, the 'For Honor' team faced many challenges. From the drastic optimizations needed to run 8 times the gameplay in a single frame, to the constant need to make your tools and processes evolve; from the desynchronization bugs that come with strict determinism, to the hard balance between shipping your game and training newcomers; Jennifer will deep dive into the mysterious world of deterministic simulation, by presenting the lessons she learned with her 'For Honor' gameplay team over the past 6 years."},

On a case by case basis this isn't a big issue, but what happens when you only concentrate on one tool at a time instead of looking at the bigger picture of how they interact with each other? Over a 40 hour development week, those small compromises from each tool start to compound on each other, resulting in a frustrating user experience. In this talk, Workflow UX Designer Laura Teeples will walk through how to develop tools as a system rather than a set of individual features and how to maintain balance without always needing to introduce new tools. She will also walk through some practical exercises for evaluating the effectiveness of your systems so you can make bigger improvements, better compromises, and a more cohesive tool set."},

The core philosophy behind this framework is to empower the game and level designers to change almost anything at anytime without touching the code base and the need for \"hard coding\". The framework is free of game play related design decisions and with few restrictions. It consists of three main elements: content management, visual scripting and additional utilities to smooth out the workflow through batch processing. It's called the Evil System."},

Offline rendering pipelines have largely converted to some flavor of ray tracing in the last decade, craving the expected consistent quality, ease of uniform content setup and extensibility of algorithms. Yet despite real-time ray tracing being a frequent buzzword over the same decade, real-time pipelines have not been able to take advantage of this functionality in a full-fledged manner, yet. With the recent advances in hardware architecture we are starting to see initial adoption of real-time ray tracing functionality into modern game engines, yet the domain is just starting to be explored. This presentation aims to share the lessons, tips and tricks from the integration of real-time ray tracing into a modern unified PBR rendering pipeline for real-time content creation focused on games and other high-end real-time experiences. The author will build on the insights learned by extending the engine architecture to support real-time ray tracing APIs and incorporating the power of real-time ray tracing to increase realism for resulting renders at interactive 30 fps rendering on high-end consumer hardware. Topics of how ray tracing can be incorporated into the artist pipeline for ease of scalable content creation for both RT ray tracing and rasterization-based pipelines will be covered. The author will also share several state-of-the art techniques developed for achieving high-visual quality in real-time rendering with usage of primary ray visibility for higher-fidelity materials including multi-layer smooth transparency, advanced approaches for shadowed textured area lights, support of dynamic indirect diffuse and specular lighting as well as other global effects, such as ambient occlusion and others, taking advantage of ray tracing algorithms. Details of approaches for merging TAA and stochastic techniques along with denoising approaches will be covered when focusing on how to achieve fast frame rates for complex scenes on GPU and CPU. Lastly, the author will discuss the insights gained through this integration and explore some of the limitations and challenges of current ray tracing APIs for modern games and game engine architectures, with several calls to action for evolving the API and hardware approaches for future generations to support the trends from gaming communities. \r\n        "},

In this talk, we will describe how we brought the ships of Starlink to life. By combining specialized but reusable behaviors, designers can control how vehicles handle in multiple navigation modes, as well as how dynamic they look on screen. The tricky bit with highly configurable vehicles is tackling the ensuing combinatorial explosion of tuning that comes from each part affecting the outcome. Finally, relaxing the coupling between physics and gameplay can lead to more interesting environmental impacts and corresponding angular momentum preserving recovery animations.\r\n        "},

At Ubisoft Quebec, the audio team realized that their game designs were now in demand of a new approach to audio; one that is more systemic. They could not rely on a traditional manual, minute-by-minute approach to audio design, integration and mixing. This presentation will cover why this is important, how the Ubisoft audio team embraced systemic audio on 'Assassins Creed Odyssey', and how they created and used tools and pipelines to support their internal development with a central focus on the player experience. The session will also cover how the team approached the complexity of constructing, recording and integrating voice, how you can improve the approach to interactive music to support character, emotion and player choice, as well as how the team aimed to maintain consistency of player experience with Foley, sfx, and ambiences. Finally, this lecture will discuss how Ubisoft brought all these elements together through systems that were a friend, not enemy, to creativity."},

Don't you need to be able to attack your opponent in order for the game to work? This lecture from board game designer Gil Hova ('The Networks') shows that attacking players in a board game isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's just that there are other ways to design a board game.Plenty of board games have achieved critical and commercial success without the players going for each other's throats or backs. The talk will break down player interaction from a theoretical point of view and then walk through games with indirect interaction (like 'Race for the Galaxy') and even zero player interaction (like 'Take It Easy'). Ultimately, this talk will look at how games with indirect or no player interaction can be satisfying, along with common pitfalls to avoid."},

Yet the modern world championships, where people compete to solve the cube and other puzzles in as fast a time as possible, was not established until 2003. Those world championships were not run by the Rubik company, but by an independent international organization of speed-solving enthusiasts, or 'speedcubers'. This community took what was a toy and, without corporate backing, turned it into a game. Then they turned that game into a genre with hundreds of variants and celebrity designers. Growth followed, with 359 competitions registered worldwide in 2013, increasing to 679 by 2016.How did the community achieve this? Was it luck, organization, or both? What type of players does speedcubing attract? What industries sprang up to support the game? How is speedcubing different to the board or video game industry, and how is it the same?"},

Twenty years ago conflict-driven designs were the norm. Interaction and player-driven chaos were staples of design. Things could not be more different today. Not only have cooperative and solo designs found a massive space in today's board game market, but even complex strategy games have moved away from direct player interaction.Wehrle will mount a defense for competitive multiplayer designs that don't shy away from giving players the ability to disrupt one another. In this light, designing for king-making (the explicit attempt to bolster another player) becomes the central key to enabling players to occupy the complex strategic positions that produce dramatic narratives. Over the past several years Wehrle has designed a series of games which attempt to investigate the subject of player agency and what can be learned from embracing strategies which push against better instincts.\r\n        "},

With controls much more demanding than those in previous Supercell games, a lot of design and prototyping effort was put into making them as simple and as well-suited for mobile touchscreen devices as possible. At the same time, a very small team with only a handful of developers needed to design a long-term player progression system that would be a good match for the team's limited content creation capacity.After the game soft launched in June 2017, its player metrics weren't quite reaching the ambitious goals. This prompted the game team to try to improve the game: not just polishing it up, but making major changes as well, while that was still possible. What followed was a more than one-year long beta where the team tried to decide between two control models but ended up with a third, and redesigned the progression system twice, both fundamental core aspects of the game. This session will present the different controls and progression solutions, and based on metrics, argue that they were all good designs and any one of these six iterations of core elements could have worked.\r\n        "},

What were the team's goals, and how did those goals shape how the pieces came together? He'll talk about how and why each component of the mode came to be, how the team iterated on that component, and why they made the decisions they made. It's the story of a passionate, empowered team that set out to create one thing, but stumbled into success by throwing out one of their initial design pillars.

At the outset of 'Spider-Man' it was estimated that the Insomniac team would develop roughly 2 hours of cinematic content before ship, and the animation team would be key to visualizing this story. Are you interested in hearing more about the journey to tell Parker's tale? In this talk, Lead Animator Brian Wyser will provide a thorough walk-through of the Insomniac Game's cinematic process for 'Marvel's Spider-Man'. He will explore more about what it's like to be an animator, and how he operated at the intersection between the page and screen. Making things move was the team's primary concern, yet cinematography, editing, and overall visual storytelling were equally as important on 'Spider-Man'."},

The talk argues that the Chinese ink artists come out on top because they explicitly tried to capture the \"dao\" or \"way\" of water rather than surface detail \"realism.\"The session will apply this perspective to VFX animation with a demo of how to create fire with leaf textures, taking advantage of the similarity between the *underlying patterns* of fire and leaves.

However, the developer can control what's on screen through use of the environment to direct the player's movements and attention. Miriam Bellard has been referring to this as spatial cinematography. Miriam's talk explores spatial cinematography in theory and practice using examples from GTA V Online DLC (pre-production to final art). A truly cinematic experience can be developed by adapting film concepts such as shots, editing and 2D screen design as well as understanding how the player interacts with and perceives the game environment. Miriam discusses the effect of the 3D environment on the cinematic experience, including through movement, player attention, and spatial design.\r\n        "},

It was early in the process that the Santa Monica team decided that 'God of War' as a franchise could not exist without its main character Kratos. The challenge was to present Kratos in a new light to the audience, a side not motivated by rage and revenge. This chapter was to focus not in the warrior side of Kratos, rather on the flawed man he is. Because of this they had to have a fresh new approach to our animation pipeline and that meant starting over in many ways. This talk will focus on the process of transforming their approach to how they animate their main character and how they evolved in delivering the narrative experience.\r\n        "},

APX is 22 design patterns that you can easily integrate into your design process to inspire you and your team to innovate more accessible game experience for players. Using APX to make accessibility decisions early in your design than is current practice, this means you save cost in time and money not having to retrofit accessibility later in the development cycle."},

A game's choice of dress or even the ability to HAVE different outfits (and not just color swaps) is both the gamers' expression of themselves and a way to create more diverse and interesting environments. Character customization, after all, could be considered another form of dress up.Offensive or lackluster fashion can be a representation of the troubling perspective that games have no space for \"feminine\" interests. Some have captured fashion well (think 'Splatoon' and 'Persona 5'), but much of game development has to catch up on this, like the infamous Quiet outfit from 'Metal Gear Solid V' or the lackluster outfits from 'The Sims 3'. The benefits to paying attention to style? Just think of the success of 'Overwatch' skins, as one example! This talk from Kitfox Games' Victoria Tran explores the recent history of fashion in games and provides multiple tips for success.\r\n        "},

William Pugh and Jan Stroetmann will take a decidedly unique approach when dissecting their indie nightmare adventure comedy 'Accounting+' (you'll have to see it in person). Lastly, students Kai Nyame and Milo Smiley will demonstrate their unique live-action game 'Ideal Meal', which allowed them to showcase at E3 and Indiecade.\r\n        "},

This year's presentation, The Developer's Journey, is a first-of-its-kind combined talk that kicks off with Media Molecule's Siobhan Reddy presenting opening remarks on how her team's upcoming title, 'Dreams' plans to unlock player creativity in unprecedented user-generated detail, following a special musical performance using the game. Next up, Hello Games' Sean Murray takes us behind the scenes during the intense and dramatic launch of one the biggest selling new IPs in recent years, 'No Man's Sky'. He will demonstrate how his team found the grit to deal with releasing an innovative and polarizing game into an increasingly vocal gaming landscape. Finally, game development veteran Laralyn McWilliams then draws on 15+ years of dev experience to close out the session with a talk about finding resolve and inspiration in a stressful environment. Using practical tools and techniques, she'll describe how to stay optimistic and inspired through unforeseen challenges. Part 1: 'Dreams': Unlocking Creativity in Everyone (Siobhan Reddy) In her talk, Reddy will discuss the evolution of Dreams from 3D sculpting tool to full blown game creation engine in the journey to bring the hobby of game creation into the living room for the modern generation. She will also cover how building a studio culture of \"jamming\" has resulted in everything from creative solutions to development problems, new games within Dreams and literal jams - musical and otherwise - in the tools. Part 2: 'No Man's Sky': Grit (Sean Murray)A small and unlikely team was behind one of the most ambitious and anticipated games of 2016. Hello Games' Sean Murray takes us behind the scenes during the intense and dramatic launch of one the biggest selling new IPs in recent years. He demonstrates how his team found the grit to deal with releasing an innovative and polarizing game into an increasingly vocal gaming landscape, and details how through determination and love in 2019 they have built to record player numbers and positivity amongst their most negative detractors. This candid and open discussion will show the power of focusing on what you do, rather than what you say, in the face of adversity.Part 3: I Don't Want Your Lemons: Optimism Fuel for Weary Devs (Laralyn McWilliams)Game development is a hard business. You've all been through the wringer, whether you're indie or commercial developers, long-time veterans or folks in their first few years as a professional. It's easy to become cynical, and that's the start of the short path to burnout. It's not your fault: there's solid evidence that stress makes creativity difficult if not impossible, especially when it's prolonged. Yet some of us persist, through crunches, layoffs, relocations and even your company closing down. What is it that keeps you here and keeps you creative? This inspirational talk provides practical tools and techniques to stay positive and creative in game development despite the bumps (and craters) in the road, drawn from the experiences of fellow developers with 15+ years in the business.

From managing day to day tasks to developing multi-year roadmaps, production is called upon to provide context, input, and guidance to help make the best decision possible across a variety of development situations. Even at the junior level, producers begin to be exposed to product-wide goals and strategic plans, needing to understand the larger scope and context of the work in order to set their teams up for success. But this privilege of information, when managed poorly, can lead to tension between producers and their teams. By learning to determine what can be shared, when is the right time to share it, and how it could be communicated, producers can help manage information on their teams in a positive and productive way."},

Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session, the speakers will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that they have encountered throughout their careers and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include creating a new IP, leading a team through creative challenges, strong but flexible leadership, leading leads, setting clear goals, managing creative differences, how to convince people, how to ask the right questions and building a new software team."},

The stories and practical toolkit of strategies will relate to recruitment, individual development, team dynamics and organizational structure. Why should you care, you ask? Simply because the gaming audience continues to evolve and become more diverse, from Candy Crush to Fortnite, and everyone needs to be factoring this into the development process. To serve that increasingly diverse audience, you need to not only talk the talk, but walk the walk when it comes to diversity.

It sounds straightforward, until you start to factor in how the individual members of your team may respond to those expectations. Some will be great at meeting deadlines on their own, while others may require more hand-holding and accountability. Some will be able to set effective boundaries, while others may take on too much, predisposing them to burnout. Some will happily carry out tasks as instructed, while others may need to understand the reasoning behind the task. And, of course, some need to do things their way, or not at all.

Oftentimes, especially in the indie game scene, composers are faced with the need to fulfill both roles as composers and sound designers. However, many have not attempted to do sound design before and are put into scenarios of constant and frustrating experimentation. Where and how does one start? How does sound design differ from composing? How is it similar? Why does being able to sound design help you understand your mix better?This panel session brings together industry veterans of various backgrounds from AAA sound design teams, tocomposer-sound-designers at the indie level. Their role will be to demystify sound design for composers, and help them understand the fundamentals as well as provide insights into their styles."},
