For HALF-LIFE 2, owing to the larger scope and scale of the project, they changed that process into an even more decentralized method employing three nearly-independent design teams (each responsible for roughly a third of the game), an art team, a sound team, and a story/acting team. This process introduced some interesting challenges: How to manage and reduce the cost of interdependencies among the six teams? How to allow each team to apply important constraints to the design? How to create a consistent design of high quality? The talk covers the answers to these questions and how Valve made this unique design process work."},

Probably the most influential step in achieving this goal was to create gaming centers called LEDzones. These are essentially gaming cafes where gamers are networked and play in a plush, unique environment. This lecture addresses two topics: how Namco remodeled Counter Strike to make it more attractive to the Japanese gamer and how Namco approached the Japanese online gaming community. The database in Counter Strike NEO has been designed to record a variety of play information from both the online player and the staff working at one of the LEDzones. This database is able to disseminate statistical analysis on features such as player action, amount of money spent and staff interaction. From these results, Namco hopes to better develop and manage the market of online gaming in Japan."},

This concept is central to all interactive media, and to games in particular. While all games offer players at least a limited degree of intentional play, some games do this to greater effect. This presentation analyzes intentional play by looking at specific examples in well known games, and distills a set of principles and approaches that will help designers create the potential for intentional play, and enable players to take advantage of that potential in their games. The presentation also examines some of the specific challenges and roadblocks to enabling intentional play, and investigates some of the costs and risks associated with the requirement of transparency that accompanies the design of highly intentional possibility spaces."},

OTOY is a web plug-in technology used by independent game developers to create browser based 3D games and content for companies such as Nickelodeon, Disney and Shockwave. The second portion of the session will examine the chat and virtual community developer tools built into OTOY, specifically, OTOY's integration with key web technologies such as Flash, HTML, Instant Messaging, E-mail and photo and file sharing. The third section will focus on the challenges of bringing advanced 3D graphics to browsers, specifically the balance between having a software rendering solution that works on all machines, and a scalable hardware architecture that matches what players now see on next generation consoles. This part of the session will introduce the new graphics engine in OTOY, which unifies vector, imaging, 2D and 3D rendering through a simple scripting language that compiles code transparently across both the GPU and CPU."}

This is not trivial; but also not newsworthy. After all, every new system is more powerful than its predecessor. Developers know what drives the video game business. It is our work. We are the creators, the innovators, the entertainers. We understand that people who imagine things, even more than the people who engineer them, are the key to reaching players. Unfortunately, the application of imagination is getting more and more difficult. Larger games require more hours, more manpower, and a lot more money. And as budgets rise, the appetite for risk falls. As Nintendo has demonstrated with Nintendo DS, our goal is to expand the industry to new players - and to surprise existing players. In Distrupting Development, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata will reveal the backstory of how a string of recent desruptive products from Nintendo - the Nintendo DS, the \"brain-training\" games, and Nintendo WiFi Connection - surprised the market. He will shae his thoughts on the role the forthcoming Nintendo Revolution will play in the console world, and how he believes that, in the process, the possibilities for every game developer will be dramatically increased."}

But whether you work for a large publisher, a small developer, or yourself, it doesnt take long to learn that games need to make money. Anybody who wants a long career in the game industry needs to understand how businesses are run, how they make money, and how to help them make more money. In large companies, game creators may get frustrated by the decisions that their managers make. The frustration may or may not be justified would you make the same decisions if you were managing the company? If you criticize a decision, can you suggest a better alternative that can actually be implemented? Once you have a good understanding of what the goals and capabilities of the business are, you can credibly critique decisions, suggest business strategies, and avoid misplaced frustration.

However, this is a technique that is too useful to overlook any longer. In an industry where we're constantly pushing the boundaries and exploring the unknown, the benefits of TDD are a very good match for many of our development problems. Developing software with TDD might seem backwards at first glance: First a short unit test is written, then the code to make that unit test pass is implemented, and finally the code can be refactored (without changing its functionality). At that point, the cycle is repeated over and over, always starting with a unit test. The cycle itself should be short, in the order of a couple of minutes and all of the tests are required to run before moving forward. TDD has some very interesting consequences: It creates a safety net of unit tests, which allows for major refactorings or introducing new features late in development without fear of breaking existing code, it forces the developer to use his own code first, so it is always written from the point of view of the user of the code, it encourages more modular, simpler code that can be easily modified and reused, and it serves as a form of documentation that, unlike comments or documents, can never get out of date. Last but not least, it provides the developer with instant feedback, building his confidence in the code and even making the programming experience much more enjoyable. The talk starts with a general overview of TDD, followed by a detailed explanation of how to put it into practice, and a live TDD demonstration implementing a high-level game task fully in TDD. The second half of the session is dedicated to some of the unique aspects of game development, such as having different hardware platforms, dealing with graphics, or using middleware and how they affect TDD. Finally, the session concludes with the lessons learned at High Moon Studios from using TDD in a variety of projects."},

Shadowbuffers have been around for a long time, but have never been quite practical enough. Some recent advances in both hardware and software algorithms now mean that shadowbuffers can be used to render fast, high-quality, soft-edged shadows in almost any situation or scene.

A few brave souls will turn to assembly language optimizations, but what about the rest of us who use C++ on a daily basis? This talk is for you.

This session offers an analysis of the current single-threaded game loop architectures, and then proceeds to cover how the architectures can be expanded to successfully transition into a Next-Generation multi-CPU hardware environment. With a focus on maximizing game performance, the analysis covers the general loop layout, variances based on timing requirements, and architectural (and performance) limitations that each variance imposes.

A graph of connected convex volumes, accurately encapsulating the usable free-space of the game world, is quickly computed from an arbitrary polygon soup of level mesh, using a straightforward 3D rasterization and volume extraction technique. Because the planning graph encapsulates the usable free-space, it supports not only path finding queries, but also repulsion field based flocking and squad behaviors, relying only on rapid checks within the planning graph, avoiding ray-casts against the collision geometry. The planning graph, while detailed enough to support these advanced motion behaviors, is simple enough that it can be updated at runtime as dynamic obstacles modify the environment."},

To date, the use of wind and water effects has fallen primarily into categories such as complex aerodynamic loading calculations for airplanes in flight simulators, simple wind resistance on objects in a strong wind, or buoyancy and water resistance on objects moving through a body of water, and water/smoke/fluid simulation of various sorts.
