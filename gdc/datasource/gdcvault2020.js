However, it can often be difficult to figure out how to collaborate with those who work and think differently than us - creating incidental barriers that can hold individuals (and their teams) back from achieving their goals. This talk breaks down those barriers by helping to bring awareness to how different people process both workplace and important industry expectations and obligations in different ways while exploring how best to celebrate and respect those differences - both in terms of one's own work and when collaborating and managing others."},

Attracting women towards tech roles is also challenging due to the small number of female tech leaders, despite women being as capable and performing on par or better than their male counterparts. There are a number of factors that get in the way of women progressing into leadership roles.In this session, the focus is to show King's strategic approach to bridge this gap in leadership via recruitment best practices and a tailored development program for women in leadership. By broadening the pool and diversifying leaders for the future, we create a culture that is inclusive to everyone and integrates D&I into core people processes so that we remove barriers preventing the hiring of diverse candidates and the development of women into leadership and influential roles."},

Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) can help with that. SDT is a macro theory of human motivation that emerged from the research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and identifies three universal psychological needs that, if satisfied, enable optimal function and growth: competence, autonomy and relatedness. In this talk, Alexandre Moufarek introduces SDT and gives practical examples taken from a manager's day to day tasks and discusses what can facilitate or undermine a team's motivation (supported by research findings). Happy game developers make happy gamers is not just a saying. It's science."},

In the past, they had trouble adding team members and maintaining their titles, and solved most problems through sheer force of will.

As games-as-a-service becomes more prevalent beyond the mobile platform, and free-to-play more widely adopted as a business model, it is important to bring product managers into teams to help manage and scale games through live operations and data-driven decisions, delivering value to users. In this talk, Devin will break down the product management role, and share his experiences integrating it into more AAA-minded teams to begin fostering a culture of data-driven decision making and iterative development.\r\n        "}

This is especially apparent today with the dominance of online games and players' increasing social expectations as we struggle to foster healthy player-to-player interactions that bring out the best in our games vs. the worst in our players. To help this talk introduces \"Player Dynamics\", a design craft to address how player interactions and motivations create and enhance our in-game and meta-game experiences. Already an established part of Riot Games' design department and increasingly at other companies, the talk will focus on the how and why, give applied examples, and equip designers with tools and frameworks to intentionally design for healthier player dynamics, whether launching a new title or improving an old one."},

This talk will use concrete examples from our award-winning games to show how we teach players about ethics through play, encourage critical thinking about media and fake-news, and make polarizing social/political issues humanely relatable.In \"Headliner: NoviNews\" you play as chief editor of the national news, deciding what articles get published every day. You watch as the world around you lives of several main characters gradually change. From the start, the game was designed to make players question their choices and become more critical of media. I will explain how we achieved that.Early in pre-development, we mined Google and Facebook data to find topics that are the most important and relatable to our target audience. We made issues relatable through personal struggles of in-game characters. We have also done the research to represent both sides of complex arguments fairly, based on actual rhetoric used in media. Our simple design principles led to complex series of trade-offs and moral dilemmas with no clear win or lose conditions. Lastly, we used gameplay mechanics to encourage (but not force) our players to organically engage in media-manipulation techniques, thus teaching players to recognize them in the real world."},

Too much work, too little time, too much tension... You've set aside a couple hours for rest and relaxation. Why on earth would you spend that time on a side project--more game development!? This quick-moving, focused lecture steps through the many benefits of creative rituals, especially around side projects. Yes, you can build skills or even kickstart your indie career, but more important, side projects can be refreshing, rebooting, and restorative. Even if you whittle away at your side project for years--even if you never release it--the act of ritual creation is part of the evergreen path to both confidence and healing. Join me to discover how the ritual of solo game development can be a part of your own restorative process, and help you win the battle against burnout."},

Today that tech powers tools used by studios across Electronic Arts, from Battlefield to Plants vs Zombies. Quad-based models are widely used in the industry, and artists devote much care to their topology and edge flow. Yet simplification of quad meshes is less studied in the literature -- and popular LOD tools triangulate meshes and ignore topology. While LODs are sometimes thought of as throwaway, maintaining good topology benefits subsequent hand-editing, lighting and animation. For that reason, Bioware historically spent days per model hand-authoring their character LODs.

First of all it was necessary to collect gameplay in a very granular manner including all possible activities that players can engage with. Additionally it was necessary to ask the same players to report their levels of competence, autonomy, relatedness and presence using UPEQ. Survey responses were processed in an ordinal fashion. Preference learning methods, based on support vector machines, were used to infer the mapping between gameplay and the 4 motivation factors. Our key findings suggest that gameplay features are strong predictors of player motivation as the obtained models reach accuracy of near certainty, from 93% up to 97% on unseen players.\r\n        "},

The general approach is to look for an ideal match across one or more preferred metrics, and then expand the ideal until a match is found. Issues with this approach make it difficult to trade-off the importance of each metric, hard to customize to specific player populations including geographic ones, and expanding forces players to wait longer than necessary. This session will present TrueMatch, a new matchmaking approach that allows developers to more intuitively express the value of each metric, and then uses machine learning to automatically optimize over the desired metrics in real-time. The results give better matches in less time and are customized to each player's characteristics and each region's real-time concurrency as it changes over time."},

The incredibly intricate relations between a character's body and his environment can only be faithfully synthesized if we avoid cheating as much as possible, and trust the physics engine as the ground truth of what is possible in the virtual world. On the other hand, data-driven animation systems utilizing large amounts of motion capture data have shown that artistic style and variety can be preserved even when tight constraints on responsiveness are required by game design. We present an animation system that combines both ideas. A virtual robot is trained using deep reinforcement learning to closely follow the output of motion matching. The ragdoll is powered with his own motors, without 'god forces' attaching its limbs to points in global space, and learns to balance itself as it follows the interactive motion capture controlled by the user and recovers from unplanned perturbations. We believe that this result is an interesting milestone on the path towards realistic interactive virtual humans.\r\n        "},

A Short HIke is a small game in both in scope and scale, and the initial release came together within a 4-month deadline. Adam will discuss the design choices and development strategies that helped him meet his goals for the project and craft a compelling open-world game within those limitations, including visual style, level design, and writing. He'll also touch on the release and the topic of setting expectations for the players to help guide their approach to the game even before they begin to play.\r\n        "}

But what we've seen is that player audiences can handle much more pathos than we give them credit for, and without the lows, you simply cannot appreciate the highs. You need both to tell a good story. Many players are drawn to games because they like to solve problems, and mystery provides a narrative problem to solve. This goes beyond the detective genre to include an element of mystery in any literary genre. Finally, connection is why players crave a populated world in their games. And they want the connections between characters, as well as between themselves and the characters, to be meaningful.\r\n        "},

Kaitlin Tremblay will discuss the inherent fiction behind our most common gameplay verbs, such as shooting, talking, deciphering (puzzle solving), hacking, etc., with specific examples from games in AAA, indie, mobile, ARGs, and escape rooms, and with a special eye toward how this becomes even more imperative in collaborative or competitive game spaces. This talk is intended to encourage greater collaboration between game design and narrative design in order to leverage the innate storytelling qualities in the fundamental building blocks of all of our games, to design together more playfully and more cohesively, and to create more compelling experiences, situations, and stories for players.\r\n        "},

Starting with the dramatic question and the sequence method, the Forest Paths Method has been built on the principles of understanding the building blocks of drama to combine narrative and design elements into successful patterns tailored to the pillars of your game. These patterns can then be used by the whole team to start a new project, problem-solve current issues, or analyse past successes or failures. This session will follow an example of a fictional new game through the process, and by the end show a narrative design pattern that could service the start of development.\r\n        "},
