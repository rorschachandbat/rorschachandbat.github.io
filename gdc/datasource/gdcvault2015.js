Volition has come to view the vertical slice (or proof of concept, or minimum viable product) as a tool that should be used to determine whether or not the team is ready to move from pre-production into production. This gate needs to satisfy both internal and external goals, and ultimately demonstrates whether or not the team understands what it is they are making and how to make it. This talk will examine where Volition has failed and succeed at making a vertical slice for our past projects, and demonstrate where we have changed our approaches and processes today to improve at planning for and executing on this major deliverable."},

Through three short case studies (a renovated space in an existing office building, an architect-designed loft, and an indie co-working storefront) this talk will look at how game-making spaces change as our industry evolves, as well as revealing spatial design best practices and unmasking trendy concepts that almost never work as planned.

Core to the talk will be the perspective that while it is more costly to run a DDO in the short term (ie: time spent on personal development, iterating on internal process, speed of hiring and organizational growth, etc) it is a benefit in the longer term. Funomena is a DDO, but it is also a company focused on building a diverse community of development.

Video games and other cultural content like films, comics, music, art, books and analog life experiences are all used as reference points for conceptualizing ideas and communicating them to dev teams. These \"cultural touchstones\" become a crucial part of everyday game studio practice, impacting everything from production efficiency to the studio's local culture and values. The potential impact of cultural touchstones on game design will be explored through a case study based on two years of ethnographic research with Red 5 Studios, Inc. during the production of Firefall. We will discuss how cultural touchstones can shape design vocabulary, influence how effectively a team communicates, and provide a basis for a whole studio's socialization. We will also look at how curating a team's cultural touchstones can maximize the benefits of a diverse team and contribute to mindful design.\r\n        "},

The intros needed to occupy a different space than the AC single player experience, yet feel connected to the brand and SP campaign! Characters and story, Robert McKee said, are actually the same thing  so stop arguing about which is more important. COOP could be played in any order  so a linear story with story arcs was out of the question. Our stories, had to be totally mission contained, and themes would instead be carried across the whole campaign. So we chose to build our mission intros like trailers for missions, and boiled them down to their absolute essence. Every step of our process was about distilling the dialogue, narration and character actions down to sharp, dynamic and short mission intros that contained the highest level of SEE-SAY possible. Our vision statement became \"ignite gameplay\" and this informed every aspect of our production. This presentation takes the audience step by step through our blueprint, elevator pitches, style guide, cinematic vision documents, treatments, first pass intro, storyboards, pre-visualization with scratch audio, and then to the animation and script team moving to in-engine pre-visualization.\r\n        "},

As one of the first games to place players in command a starship and allow them to chart their own course -- either alone or with a friend -- in a remarkably well-realized virtual galaxy, Star Control and its many sequels blazed a trail that game developers still follow today. In the more than two decades since the game's release, Ford and Reiche III have gone on to launch a string of titles across a variety of genres, most recently finding great success with Toys For Bob's Skylanders series of games. Now they're coming to GDC in March to speak at length about their work creating the both the original Star Control as well as the critically acclaimed Star Control II, the influences that inspired their design and the challenges they faced during development."},

Adventure is particularly notable for (among other things) being one of the first graphical action-adventure games ever released. Adventure also contained one of the earliest known \"Easter eggs\" ever hidden in a game by a designer -- in this case, a hidden screen revealing Robinett's name and authorship at a time when Atari was unwilling to publicly credit game makers for their work. Thus his efforts to create Adventure meaningfully advanced both the practice of game development and the fight for developers to be recognized for their work. The talk is about the implementation of Adventure. For clarity, the game code has been translated into C (from its original 6502 assembler code). Because memory was extremely expensive in the late 70's, the program for Adventure had to fit into a 4K-byte ROM chip. Therefore the program was very short -- barely a dozen pages of C code. The game had 30 rooms, and 18 objects of 12 different types -- the square Man (the player's avatar), the Chalice (the Grail-like goal of the game), 3 castles with matching keys to open them, 3 dragons and a sword to kill them, a bat that flew in and stole your stuff, a magnet that attracted things, several mazes and a bridge that let you cross its walls. How was all this jammed into 4K? A good data structure was the heart of the game: the room-list and object-list. There was also a very effective \"Behavioristic\" scheme for giving \"desires\" and \"fears\" to the creatures in the game (which caused them to flee from or pursue certain other objects). For more implementation details, see the E-book \"The Annotated Adventure\" (warrenrobinett.com/adventure). Within this highly-compressed code can be seen the skeleton of the modern adventure game, boiled down to its essentials."},

We'll discuss why these abstract, strange and \"unprofessional\" approaches to design and aesthetics are actually a secret strength of the medium that should be embraced as powerful and progressive communicative tools. We'll also examine why they are, in fact, far more powerful artistic tools than literal representation, or already deeply-entrenched approaches in the game industry and game culture."},

As a result, games are typically analyzed as responsive dynamic systems. However, while this way of thinking about games yields useful insights into many types of games, it breaks down when it is applied to low-interaction play spaces like Dear Esther and Gone Home. Some have even gone so far as to claim that such experiences are not games at all. This talk offers a new methodology for the design and analysis of non-interactive play spaces. It lays out six heuristics for good experiential design, and illustrates how they work by using them to analyze three successful low-interaction experiences: the airport escape in Thirty Flights of Loving, the blizzard sequence in Journey, and P.T., the playable demo for the upcoming Silent Hills."},

They expect deeper immersion with AI and more emergent gameplay that will add replay value. In ACU, we accomplished this by developing non-player-centric systemic events, capable of creating spontaneous gameplay opportunities for the players. This lecture looks back at the development of the system from both a game designer and a programmer's perspective, and how we overcame some of the challenges presented by systemic gameplay via concrete examples. This talk will present the initial vision for the system, our design intentions, problems we met as we iterated on the system, and the solutions we used, integration with other crowd systems, level and mission design concerns, as well as avenues of improvement."},

In this session, he will discuss the development of D4 and his attempts to empathetically connect to players using a design method called \"sensory replication.\" One of the core design goals in D4 was to engage players at an emotional level. Another was to find a way to allow players who hate motion controls to enjoy the game using a Kinect. After much trial and error, SWERY and his team at Access Games realized that these two goals could be addressed at the same time. The answer was a game design pattern called \"sensory replication.\" Sensory replication attempts to connect the player to the moment-to-moment events on the screen at a visceral level. When it works, the empathetic impact is dramatic. However, building a game around sensory replication is difficult, and its effects are not guaranteed. In this talk, SWERY will discuss the theory behind sensory replication and show how it influenced his design of D4. In addition, he'll talk about how building this game forced him to reevaluate many of his preconceived notions about game design.\r\n        "},

Designing levels for Counter-Strike: GO is illustrative of broader challenges in multiplayer game design. For instance, Counter-Strike levels should always reward players and teams for skillful play, while at the same time providing ample opportunities for individual and team creativity. Collaborating with professional players and other experts is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of the specific game mechanics unique to Counter-Strike. Modern level designers must also understand the relationship of art design to a competitive experience: the form of a CS level should match the function of that level, such that there is no point at which level art exists only for art's sake, or is detrimental to gameplay."},

How can museums and archives share not only the games themselves, but also educate the public on the processes and practices that are the past and present of game design and development? And how can game makers help curators design compelling and informative exhibits that reveal the way that games are made, and how they work on players? A panel of speakers from a wide range of fields - from game historians to curators and museum directors - will describe their work and share their thoughts, and listen to the the ideas and suggestions from game developers themselves. The end goal: discovering what can we do to contribute to the public understanding of game-making as a creative practice, as an industry, and as a craft."},

This panel will provide students with a comprehensive plan to \"Get hired, and stay hired\" right out of school. Students at all stages of their education (even post-grad), from all backgrounds & from all levels of experience are encouraged to attend."},

In this talk, lead engineer Zach Aikman will discuss a few different failed approaches before presenting a detailed breakdown of Galak-Z's dungeon generator, including its usage of some unorthodox math, and his thoughts on the proper balance between hand-crafted and procedural content."},

The playing field is wide open when it comes to designing VR-centric gameplay systems, but the stakes are high: poorly implemented designs often result in the player feeling sick. Good VR also requires competent 3D graphics running at a rock solid frame rate. Building an interesting and convincing virtual space on mobile hardware is a tricky proposition. In the summer of 2014, Robot Invader decided to rebuild its current project, a moody murder mystery called Dead Secret, as a mobile VR game. Originally designed for tablets, the title was rebuilt from the ground up to accommodate mobile VR. From the pacing to the interface, the sound system to the monetization plan, everything changed. After months of work, Dead Secret is not only playable on mobile VR platforms, it's a much better game. This talk will discuss the challenges and benefits of targeting mobile VR platforms, and discuss in detail how mobile developers can approach this new platform. This talk is focused on specific design considerations for mobile VR, the decisions we made in Dead Secret, tips and tricks we learned along the way, and how we might do it differently in the future."},

How do we turn our good intentions into actionable change? By creating safe spaces for gamers of all stripes to participate and have their voices heard. A safe space is an environment where participants are free to be themselves without fear of discrimination. The speakers on this panel organize some the most prominent and innovative safe-space events in gaming.

Now the term addiction has become an accusation labeled at apparently unscrupulous free-to-play designers who are leveraging the psychology of operant conditioning to allegedly extort money from players. Games that delight us often become habit-forming, but how as designers can we judge the balance between a game as a social good and the manipulation of an audience. There are huge opportunities if we can build a loyal fanbase of regular, invested players -- and huge (potentially legal) risks if we are considered to have overstepped the line into manipulation. In this session, Oscar explores the *available psychological evidence to understand the differences between habit and addiction, and to uncover the real risks of using manipulation in game design, and how we can use an understanding of habit-forming behavior responsibly. *With help from Berni Good, http://www.cyberpsychologist.co.uk.\r\n        "},

During the early phases of development we spent time standardizing this environment art workflow and boosting its efficiency with a UV mapping script for quick and precise UV layout and a special shader for the unique texture style and added variation.

This provides a way to mix and match various parts of the sim without causing interpenetration of geometries. Deformation maps provides another innovative way to deform 3D characters. The lecture will describe in what cases it gives advantages over morph geometries and bone-driven modifications. Direct manipulation allows users to create sims of their choice by tugging and pulling on the character directly. The system is built around data-driven selectors and modifiers that include morph targets, bones-driven deformations and deformation maps for shape manipulations. Smart randomization allows automated generation of sims with consistent look by putting together assets that match certain attributes."},

Car companies build full-scale clay models of their cars before they ever see an assembly line. You can watch a movie as a 3D pre-visualization before any actors are cast. Yet, when it comes to the games industry, we often begin developing tools without first having a shared vision of what we're building, and who we're building it for. This presentation will discuss why this is happening, as well as the potential risks if we don't evolve our tools development process. Attendees will also learn a handful of user-centered design techniques, and how they can be used to create a shared vision to improve our tools. Finally, the presentation will include examples of internal Ubisoft tools that exhibited these issues, how having a shared vision helped to improved them, and how that helped their respective teams."},

You'll see why some parts of the code were much more costly than initially planned, as well as the position of the cloth simulation module inside the game engine loop and the consequences. For the next games in development, the team took the decision to port the cloth simulation to the GPU. The second part of the talk will explain in detail how the performance increased by a factor of more than 10 when entirely rewriting the cloth simulation with compute shaders on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The speaker will explain the difficulties that were overcome while working with compute shaders, the performance one can expect (real vs. theoretical), as well as what can and cannot be done with compute shaders."},

The networking ecosystem that we built is unique - an intersection of our traditional peer-to-peer networking and a new cloud-based server architecture. This talk will discuss the spatial structure of Destiny's game world, each of the various networked experiences a player may be simultaneously connected to, and their overlapping responsibilities. Rules for host handoff at regional boundaries will be described, along with how we handle ungraceful host migrations and disconnections. Because untethered cooperative play is a pillar of our game, we will discuss the consequences and complexities these places on mission scripting and gameplay simulation."},

First, the foundations were laid down by lighting and material improvements. An anisotropic BRDF was created, high-resolution directional sky occlusion was added, and the global illumination system was extended. Next, the vegetation system was rewritten from scratch, resulting in individual leaves being modelled up close to tessellated, displaced billboards in the distance, complete with physics simulation. Finally, overall image quality was improved through the use of temporal stabilization using motion vectors, SMAA and our \"flip quad\" super-sampling."},

Using a few curves, an artist can lay out a city of streets, a network of railroad tracks, or the ocean from the shores to the horizon. In minutes, a new area of the game with final assets is playable in engine. The rapid turnaround allowed designers to test many possible street layouts and elevations, and view final (or close to final) geometry, before involving environment artists. Once turned over, environment artists could concentrate on the buildings, instead of hand-modeling custom ground. This session explains the ground and many other systems used to create Sunset City."},

We'll explain how we massively reduced the compile time of our 2.5M lines of C++ code to under a minute. We'll describe how we built a network cache for \"binarized\" assets on commodity PCs, outperforming million-dollar commercial hardware. We'll show how we used this asset store to speed up our data builds, and how we accelerated our package distribution to be instantaneous for hundreds of concurrent users.

This talk will start with the base requirements of VR rendering, and it will progress into advanced rendering topics focusing on both performance and visual quality. First generation consumer HMD's are expected to require renderers to shade over 4 million pixels per frame at a minimum of 90 fps. Due to the wide FOV of these HMD's, each pixel ends up feeling lower resolution than viewing the same image on a monitor and requires better shading algorithms than rendering in non-VR. Higher resolution rendering and higher quality pixels at much higher frame rates than games traditionally target is cause for taking a step back and rethinking many aspects of rendering. Some topics that will be covered include: efficient stereo rendering, reducing rendering latency, saturating the GPU despite synchronization points, reducing pixel cost for low-priority pixels, specular antialiasing, constrained anisotropic lighting, and other tips and tricks relating directly to VR rendering performance and quality."},

Bungie's new game Destiny is a fast-paced shared-world shooter that demands a low-latency action gameplay experience. We have taken traditional job-based multithreading techniques to the next level, turning almost every part of our engine into a job graph, with only limited use of thread-based pre-emption. To do this, we have developed several novel techniques, such as splitting our main game loop into special strings of jobs which we call \"job fibers.\" We will present our resource tracking system that allows rigorous validation multithreaded data lifecycles.

In addition, when needing to support a vast array of feature sets with limited budgets, the costs of producing large amounts of animation and in-game memory become increasing concerns. This talk will discuss a philosophy and a range of techniques revolving around preserving animation content and creating coverage through the use of correcting and manipulating motion. Using specific use-cases as examples from our upcoming title, Just Cause 3, we will demonstrate the techniques used to maintain responsiveness and preserve animation quality.

The gulf between what players can imagine and how computers can react to it remains wide. But what if we were to truly put the story into our players' hands? After all, storytelling is the most fundamental human creative trait. Using a variety of other non-traditional games as examples, this session challenges designers to build experiences that hand players the narrative car keys and say, \"floor it!\""},

Clever uses of art, interface and UX can make an experience \"cinematic\" without ever having a single camera cut, and make players walk away feeling like they visited a movie like it was a place."},

The truth however, is that there is a much stronger need for quality sub-narratives: side missions, quests, and parallel narrative arcs that become exercises in brevity and focus. The immersion provided by gaming has shown the medium is uniquely suited to benefit from the depth a strong sub-narrative can provide. This session focuses on hands-on principles gleaned from the creation of the parallel universe of Shangri-La from Ubisoft's recently released Far Cry 4, along with a look into the development of several Murder Mysteries from Assassin's Creed: Unity. This is an examination of tools game writers can use to ensure their sub-narrative contributes, and does not detract from, a healthy and immersive narrative world for the player."},

I'll talk about my process for creating Stanley, the AI in ROCKETSROCKETROCKETS, and how that can be applied to other games, as well as look at other AI examples from my own work and other games to help illustrate the techniques."},

This talk will go in-depth on the audio creation, starting with the esthetic inspiration through content creation and implementation.\r\n        "},

Trust systems build on reputation systems in that they attempt to determine how players will behave in new situations. This lecture will present results from research in computational aspects of trust and reputation. It will show how \"trust\" can be formalized mathematically using decision theory and game theory, and then directly applied to game mechanics and player metrics.

The lecture will first give a brief overview of state-of the-art, velocity-based approaches (e.g., RVO and ORCA) summarizing both their advantages and drawbacks.

In the second half Matt will \"open the books\" on Crossy Road's financials proving that it can pay to do things differently in free-to-play."},

Though traditionally seen as less lucrative than free-to-play games, these innovative pockets in pay-to-play games offer game designers and producers a glimpse into where they might take the F2P category in the coming months and years. In this talk, veteran creative directors Kenny Shea Dinkin (Diner Dash, ClueFinders, Carmen Sandiego, Dream Chronicles) and Ray Holmes (Farmville, League of War, Alpha Protocol, Bloodrayne 2) explore the more innovative niches of today's mobile and online pay-to-play design landscape, shedding light onto what free-to-play game designers might want to take with them as they explore and grow the other end of the marketplace.\r\n        "},
