One key separator is the ability to drive a cultural shift on a team, in a studio or across a global organization. It's being able to identify a systemic problem and methodically refocus the lens that everyone is using until each person understands the change they must embody. But this sounds like a job for the GM or VP of Organizational Effectiveness. Not at all: any leader at any level can drive change from the grassroots as I've done inside Electronic Arts."},

To take on the daunting task of creating the massive volume of assets needed for (the cutscenes in) FF XIII, we had to come up with ways to minimize mistakes while maintaining a high level of quality. A large-scale, highly compartmentalized production team such as the FINAL FANTASY development group must be able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously and minimize issues caused by upper process delays. We will explain how we maximized efficiency through the use/creation of appropriate tools, systematic decision-making methods and new technology. The presentation will contain video and stills taken during the actual development period, chronologically documenting steps in the workflow from storyboard to actual implementation. We hope that by sharing our experience with you, we can lay down the foundation for a productive forum on the topic of workflow/production management."},

But what makes virtual goods so desirable that people are willing to spend real money to get them? Several answers have been put forward that consist of factors such as self-expression and competitive advantage. Such abstractions offer little guidance to the developer designing their next virtual item, however. In this presentation, the question is approached from a very practical angle: what attributes are important in a virtual good for making it desirable to the users? What attributes do the users look at in a virtual item when making a purchase decision? Using fascinating examples from the past ten years of Western and Asian virtual goods success stories, the presentation will arrive at a model of ten concrete virtual item attributes that designers can adjust to influence the desirability of their offerings."},

This evolution toward free has profound implications for how the games industry operates and what types of innovations will be important in the future. The retail component of boxed games will not end any time soon-- but an increasing amount of value to consumers is offered after the initial purchase, and game publishers from all segments of the industry will have to deal with the consequences of free.

Historical examples such as correspondence chess and fantasy sports have been played since long before the advent of electronic gaming. However, it is through the recent proliferation of the internet and social networking websites that these games have seen an explosion of popularity. While these games have existed for centuries, there has been little exploration in that time of the aspects that make them uniquely appealing to very wide audiences. In this lecture, two of the creators of Skyrates, an award-winning sporadic game created at Carnegie Mellon University discuss the past, present, and future of sporadic games with a focus on knowledge and lessons that other designers can use to improve their game projects."},

By 2006, the Mystery Case Files series invigorated the industry with the introduction of narrative-driven Hidden Object Games (HOGs) a genre that has been gradually morphing consumer expectations, showcasing puzzle adventure gameplay interwoven with richer story lines, and narrative themes borrowing largely from prime time television or paperback bestsellers. 2009 saw the release of Dire Grove, Drawn, Avenue Flo, Princess Isabella, and other casual blockbusters perplexingly comparable to the graphic adventure games of the mid 90s. In this talk, Kenny Shea Dinkin, Chief Creative Officer at PlayFirst explores this alluring trend: Why is this happening? What does it mean? Where will it take us over the coming year or two? If storytelling and popular character IP development are maturing in the downloadable arena with meaningful results, what implications does that have for other mass market game categories like online, iphone and social?"},

Trademarks protect your brand; copyrights protect your content; and patents can be used to broadly protect your ideas, while company critical information can be safeguarded as a trade secret.

Don't let this happen to you! This seminar will discuss what you need to know NOW to protect your intellectual property, and will discuss proactive steps you can take to ensure that you maximize your intellectual property rights in your video game and software."},

Panelists from today's most respected developers will share examples of successful community integration at their studios while offering glimpses into how and why such changes were enacted. They'll also address thorny topics such as whether community-building falls under game design or marketing, whether community can be measured and monetized, and when should community be tuned out during development.

We provide an analysis of how and why some games in particular create higher levels of immersion and consistency, and we propose ways in which dynamic game systems can be used to expand upon these techniques. The lecture presents the techniques for environmental storytelling, the key to the creation of game spaces with an inherent sense of history; game spaces that invite the player's mind to piece together implied events and to infer additional layers of depth and meaning. In addition to commonly-used environmental storytelling tools (such as props, scripted events, texturing, lighting and scene composition), we present ideas for using game systems to convey narrative through environmental reaction. Environmental storytelling engages the player as an active participant in narrative; game systems that reflect the player's agency can do the same. The lecture will analyze existing cases and provide a framework for dynamic environmental storytelling in games."},

Soon, she returned to her native paper prototyping and eventually started work upon a series of six intentionally non-digital 'gallery games' each designed to explore a difficult topic. The result of this trek proved incredibly eye-opening and rewarding for her as a designer and culminated in the highest praise for a game she had ever received. In this lecture, Brathwaite talks about the design process of her series the Mechanic is the Message and specifically the award-winning game Train, and shares what she learned from our brothers and sisters in that other medium when she cut the cord, became incredibly inspired, and learned to love design."},

The experience of the single-player game arises from minute details of interaction, while the multiplayer game is much more about competition and mechanics. The lecture ends with suggestions to help guide the designer's thinking and avoid mistakes caused by assuming that all game design is the same."},

In the world of small indie games, it can be hard to land a strike without falling into one or the other of those gutters.

Rewinding is heavily used, and higher-level gameplay concepts are built on top of it, so it was important for rewinding to be robust, exactly reproducing the game scene at each given time. Furthermore, the game design required the player to be able to rewind a large amount of gameplay (30 to 60 minutes) and the memory of this gameplay had to fit into a small space (40 megabytes on consoles). This session explains in detail how these things were accomplished and offers an understanding of what the different possibilities were, why the current method was chosen, and knowledge of many practical implementation concerns and how they were solved."},
