This makes that in many current mainstream games, most of the content that occupies the volume of the game installation file is these high-resolution texture materials. We will show how to use the mathematical tools of Turing pattern and Fractal, combined with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to construct a very efficient natural texture generation program to greatly save the high-definition texture space in the game. This technology can be used to generate the appearance texture of various animals and plants, and can also be used to generate the changeable natural growth state such as plant branches and vines.\r\n        "},

With AAA game source data exceeding 10 TB, and content creators needing to work across multiple branches, it has become steadily less practical to require these volumes of data transfer. When the Covid-19 pandemic sent all of our employees to work from their homes, our development process ran into the limitations of multi-day network data transfers and we were faced with the need to physically transport hard drives back and forth. VirtualSync is our answer: a virtual file system that seamlessly fetches assets on-demand as-needed, allowing us to shrink up-front syncs by 98% or more. We show how this simple idea requires a number of complex engineering challenges to be solved. We will present numerous problems encountered and the solutions we developed to solve performance issues, operating system limitations, service monitoring at scale and more.\r\n        "},

This normally isn't a skill that is taught in schools, and instead usually requires a few years of building up \"intuition\" in the real world.This talk will explain steps coders new to an engine can go through to figure out how a system works and will enumerate this seemingly automatic and hard to explain process for more senior programmers looking to teach new hires more efficiently.\r\n        "},

A visibility buffer is drawn as a pre-pass followed by analysis and shading steps which run entirely in compute shaders. The use of compute shaders also provides extra flexibility that allows for the implementation of a software variable rate shading solution. Due to being able to run on the compute pipes on PS4 and PS5 it is able to overlap both the G-Buffer rendering and the rendering of cascaded shadow maps meaning that analysis and shading typically have very little overhead. This presentation will describe details of the system, and the optimizations and design choices made to integrate it into the Decima engine.\r\n        "},

Subtle bugs can cause out-of-date or corrupt data to 'leak' from one build to the next, causing subsequent builds to become unreliable over time. nnUnfortunately, developers often do not have the bandwidth (or proper licenses) to fix these bugs, so they revert back to using hours-long clean builds, abandoning the benefits of incremental. nnThis talk presents an engine-agnostic system that uses file-system snapshots and virtual volumes to turn leaky incremental builds into perfectly reliable ones. We will discuss the unique benefits of virtual file systems, and how we have integrated them into our build process with Unity.\r\n        "},

However, most simple approaches will fail, creating oddly curved trajectories or failing under large forces. This is a common behavior that many games might need for targeting, animation, and physics. Why is this so challenging?nnIn this talk, we will do a deep dive into the creation of a mathematically accurate quaternion spring. We'll learn how to take the derivative of a quaternion, explore concepts such as the swing-twist decomposition, and emerge on the other side with a fully working quaternion spring implementation, fit to be dropped into any game project.nnThe math isn't all that complex, and plus, visualizing the 4th dimension is a ton of fun!\r\n        "},

In parallel, they built a dynamic story engine that enabled the creation of over 3,000 events, each with their own unique triggers and effects, adding variety, texture, and depth to the game without bloating the design.\r\n        "},

When presenting a game level, one cannot rely on the adage of showing rather than telling. A game level has too many moving parts for that.

Cross Play for Destiny 2 required standing up many new systems that affected many fundamental parts of the game. From new core matchmaking and networking tech to building out a completely new social graph to supporting cross-platform friends and invites, all the inter-dependencies required the close collaboration of many teams at Bungie. This talk is a case study of the experience the team went through in bringing their players together across seven platforms. We'll discuss the goals which the team set out to accomplish, the approaches and decisions that needed to be made along the way, and how Cross Play was released and maintained in the live game. Lessons and reflections will be shared from what it took to unite players in a single Destiny Universe. \r\n        "},

Artists tend to use color to express the level of equipment, the state of items, or a reminder of the danger degree. These colors can quickly introduce players to the game content, while maximizing the creativity and expressiveness of the artists. Unfortunately, however, this color information is not the case for minority groups.Nowadays, there are many players having color vision deficiency all over the world. However, most of them are not given efficient attention they deserve. Being unable to distinguish some color-related information in the game, those players often fail to fully enjoy the fun of the game. How to make good use of color and enable more minority players enjoy the game is a huge challenge for artists. In the game NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, we paid close attention to the game experience of players having color vision deficiency. We focused on meeting those minority players' core needs and won both market and reputation for the game. The Accessibility Design in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT has won the praise from players with color vision deficiency in STEAM, helping expand approximately 10% of the potential market. In the meanwhile, we are in process of establishing The Accessibility Design standards of NetEase game, aiming to set a benchmark for Chinese overseas games.\r\n        "},

We must, however, pay significant attention to how these are perceived and interpreted by human visual system. While our vision is highly effective in the everyday sense, there are many evolutionary adaptations and peculiarities that technically make the system inaccurate and prone to misinterpretation. It is also the case that some elements of visual scenes are of much higher importance for our perception while others may well be de-emphasized or completely ignored. The challenge for computer graphics is thus to maximize rendering the former and minimize the latter in order to display interactive scenes efficiently. In the talk presented at GDC 2021: \"Better Computer Graphics through Understanding of Human Visual System\" multiple issues related to human visual perception of static images were overviewed, notably shape, hue, shadows and illumination perception. In this talk we would like to discuss important follow-up topics related to effects of motion and animation on human perception such as human perception of the frame rate, motion recognition at different angles of the visual field, effect of color on motion recognition, optic flows and space perception.\r\n        "},

The interpretation of dance moves not only shows the dancer's emotional expression, but also contains profound cultural connotations. In the market, the use of dance in games is mainly focused on dance games, but in fact, the significance of dance to games is much deeper and broader. \"Justice Online\" is a high quality MMORPG developed by NetEase Games Thunder Fire with a background in the Northern Song Dynasty. The action designer shows the accumulation of dance culture in the Northern Song Dynasty by restoring the real dance movements in the game.Because the background era of the game belongs to the Northern Song Dynasty, the action designers chose Chinese classical dance. Classical dance is a representative dance in traditional Chinese art, which can be traced back to ancient Chinese court dances. It is a dance that combines strength and softness, and its interpretation has a certain degree of difficulty. If it is produced purely through animation, the actual deductive effect will lack artistic expression. Therefore, we invited famous national dancers to choreograph the dance moves in Justice Online and use motion capture technology to simultaneously map the graceful posture of the dancers into the game. With the help of a professional choreographer team, the elegance and extravagance of the Song Dynasty are presented in a panoramic view of the dance.The uniqueness of stage art is that each scene is unique, and each scene cannot be reproduced or copied. Art is very valuable. We have been committed to dialogue with dance artists and continue and reuse their artistic creations through motion capture technology. At the same time, through the dance performance in the game, to achieve the publicity and influence of the dance art on the players. Through this lecture, you can understand how we cooperate with dancers through motion capture technology in game action design, and how to use dance actions in animation production and character action design.\r\n        "},

In this talk, Simon Habib, Lead Technical Animator at Eidos Montreal, presents the innovations that were implemented to accomplish this.nnFrom simultaneously capturing the actors' performances on an in-house mocap stage to delivering final polished facial animations, their pipeline offers quantity without sacrificing quality. Batch processing with Faceware allows them to generate hours of facial animations for both in-game dialogue and cinematics.

Therefore, the art of hairstyle is crucial to highlight the personality of a character.However, there is a big difference between East and West in hair evolution and game hair design. This presentation will introduce the differences between Eastern and Western hairstyles in games and their understanding of game haircuts design methods.The speech will first briefly review the history of hair art and the evolution of hair making technology of the game, after which the speaker will summarize four key thoughts of hair art design in the game.History - experience: Game hair design that is in line with the character's era will give players a better sense of immersion. The speaker will state the historical immersion of haircuts through a series of historical paintings of East and West and a series of game haircuts comparisons.Diversity - personality: Researchers in NetEase found through extensive research that in addition to customizing their faces in the game, players also pay great attention to the matching of hairstyles. This section will also include a demonstration of the effects and methods of haircut art design in terms of diversity and personality with real cases from NetEase.Contrast - memorability: A long curly hair, for example, naturally suggests a feminine, gentle aura. But if a male character with a big beard has long curly hair, which brings contrary to imaginations, will give birth to a strong memory point.Label breaking - universal value: In the current real world, many people are labeled \"hairstyle tags\" and then brought into games while these tags are spread and strengthened to certain extents afterwards. In this part, the speakers will discuss how to break this design concept and try to use game art exploration to convey universal values.\r\n        "},

However, to make use of this new technology a game engine must generally create a BVH of all scene geometry and bind all materials active in the scene. This requirement is often at odds with the dynamic nature of scene composition and material systems. Kickstart RT presents a novel cross-API (Direct3D11, Direct3D12 & Vulkan), cross-platform (win64 & ARM) solution that caches direct lighting information into a world space structure that is then used to ray trace reflections, GI and shadows. In this talk, we'll deep dive into the mechanisms and the algorithm used in Kickstart RT, and show off the quality and performancecompared to traditional ray tracing and reference path tracing. The aim of this technology is to enable many developers to add ray tracing effects to their game engine in a much shorter timespan than it might otherwise take and to bring ray tracing to developers still using Direct3D11.\r\n        "},

We take a new step on applying machine learning in game AI to transform the way a character AI expresses its emotion, which generally has been limited to facial expression, body gesture, and vocal intonation. In particular, we adopted neural style transfer that visualizes the AI's feeling. The session covers how the emotion controls the style transfer, the in-depth explanation of the style transfer model, and how it is implemented in the game. The character AI documents what it sees along its journey in the form of painting and uses style transfer to visualize its feeling to the player, allowing a new kind of player-AI interaction in the game. The character can also use style blending and region masking to focus on a particular aspect of the paintings according to its interests.\r\n        "},

Driven by \"passion,\" they're often seen as leaders and MVPs. However, the habits and attitudes that martyrs and mavericks instill have long-term consequences for team and project health. Their work often leads to scope bloat for downstream departments, shortcuts that accrue bugs and tech debt, and mistrust between \"less committed\" devs who resent the scope creep on the one hand and rogue agents hacking in risky and unaccounted-for content on the other. This talk will examine how the unchecked enthusiasm of mavericks and martyrs can sabotage a team, healthier approaches that can foster sustainable and collaborative passion, and practical steps leads and producers can take to steer devs in a more productive direction without squashing their joy for their work.\r\n        "},

But story development in games can be expensive boondoggles, as player agency crashes into the team's crafted narrative. Are studios destined to struggle and suffer in order to bring gameplay and story together? Or is there a better way?

However, with limited resources and a typical focus on actual game development, it is often hard to execute the marketing and business side effectively. This session will lay out a community validated deployment framework to connect the game making process with the need to build marketing momentum leading up to launch. This is all the stuff that needs to get done BEFORE you get into Early Access (eg, running private betas). The goal is to move beyond market/competitive analysis oriented estimates, and instead leverage community building to both assist in game product iteration and market fit. This approach brings your social media and community efforts in alignment with a clear call to action and lays the foundation for launching successfully.

Tapping into rigorous academic research conducted by the speaker, this lecture shares historical trends in game character design over the years and conveys insights pulled from 19 interviews with game designers about how these tropes have been encouraged, maintained, and eventually challenged in professional game studios. This research found that stereotypical and status quo character designs were historically institutionalized as normalized design practices, aided by a largely homogenous (i.e., mostly male and mostly white) labor force in the games industry. Building off these themes, this lecture discusses three key opportunities for industry practitioners and educations to challenge the status quo in game character design and ultimately adopt a more inclusive approach.\r\n        "},

How do we make games that leverage this? nIn this presentation, we explore a game design paradigm that uses information to create an immersive and empowering experience for an intellectual audience. Using examples from award nominated management and mystery games, The Shrouded Isle and Lucifer Within Us, we discuss how designers can use tools like the Information Horizon, the Information Game Loop and hidden information to reward players for their foresight and cunning.\r\n        "},

Global Game Jam partnered with the U.S. Government's Cultural Antiquities Task Force (CATF), led by the U.S. Department of State, to create the Cultural Heritage Game Jam in November 2021. The Cultural Heritage Game used the powerful medium of games to raise awareness about the importance of cultural heritage to local communities. The jam was a great success, with about 900 developers participating from 72 countries to create 116 games. Come hear this engaging panel session that will discuss why the State Department considers games a powerful tool for combatting threats to cultural heritage and see the outcome of the jam itself with examples of some of the solutions created by the global developer community. Most importantly, meet the jam team that created the winning game \"Purunmachu: Whispers of the Chachapoyas\" based on pre-Columbian Peruvian cultures. They will discuss their work and how their game grapples with the complex issues of cultural heritage looting, protection, and community values. \r\n        "},

It's an introspection about how the pandemic allowed the industry to reexamine how things are donefiguring out what's important (and perhaps what's not), and how things can be better moving forward. Topics include: finding the right balance in a remote/hybrid work environment, taking a stronger approach to addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, and empowering developers to \"kill it with kindness.\"Part 1: Reimagining Eidos-Montral: Shifting Our Organizational Structure by David Anfossi (Head of Studio, Eidos-Montral) The pandemic pushed video game studio Eidos-Montral to rethink their balance between well-being and efficiency in a remote/hybrid work environment. They worked to adapt their organizational structure, exploring ways to do things differently and engaging their staff in between ways. Sometimes, the results were great; other times, they had to go back to the drawing board. In this Main Stage session, head of studio David Anfossi will be sharing some of Eidos-Montral's findings during this transition.Part 2: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging: Sony Interactive Entertainment's Journey to Improve DE&I During the Pandemic and Beyond by Davina Mackey (Director, PlayStation Studios QA & President, Black@PlayStation)Since the start of the pandemic, there have been racial and gender-based current events that have impacted organizations across the globe, including the video game industry. Some organizations made a conscious decision to remain silent. Others responded with commitments to support social justice initiatives and advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). In this session, Director of Support Services and Operations & Black@PlayStation Employee Network President Davina Mackey will share what initiatives Sony Interactive Entertainment chose to take a stance against racial injustice and increase its efforts to support DE&I.Part 3: Killing it with Kindness and Intention ...Devolver and Beyond by Mike Wilson (Founding Partner, Devolver Digital) Devolver Digital started as a scrappy, punk rock group of five industry veterans and outlaws with a mission to elevate indie gameswithout compromising artistic or business integrity. In this session, co-founder Mike Wilson reflects on what he considers the keys to the small team's successful run over the past 12 years, and where he plans to take those hard-learned lessons into the future: Through purpose, intention, and integrity, all of which is grounded in basic kindness. \r\n        "},

The Game Designer's Notebook asks seasoned game designers to open up a few pages from their notebook, and share insights and explorations into contemporary design issues in the F2P game design arena. Part microtalk, part design review, the GDN is the session at the GDC F2P Summit where game designers get to jump in, go deep and jump out. This year's session will offer: Toiya Kristen Finley - Schnoodle Media, LLCA simple way to define narrative design is to say that it delivers story using any aspect of a game, from the worldbuilding and dialogue to the UI and camera angles. All members of a team can contribute to a game's narrative design, including individuals who don't consider themselves to be storytellers. Discussions on great narrative design tend to be limited to console and PC games, but mobile developers are using clever concepts to mature storytelling in this space. This micro talk explores various ways to implement narrative design into story-heavy and non-story-oriented mobile games, and how all members of the team can be encouraged to take ownership of their project's narrative design.Christopher Foster - Hidden DoorAdvances in Machine learning have the potential to invent new kinds of games and experiences. One particularly exciting opportunity is in using natural language generative technology to enable a new type of narrative play: the co-creation of improvised stories. These opportunities require a shift in approach towards probabilistic design, where the potential for emergent delight comes with issues of editorial control and safety. These novel experiences also have the potential to enable new economic models for content. This microtalk presents early findings and helpful perspectives for exploring this gaming frontier.Michelle Woods - Haiku GamesAs game makers, we all strive to create moments of joy for our players, like rolling a Yahtzee, defeating a boss, or plunking a Tetris piece into place. It can be tricky to get these moments right. Simple design flaws can get in the way, deflating the moment, or missing it completely. It can be especially tricky in games that rely strictly on skill or brainpower rather than chance, as they're more prone to causing frustration, making players feel stuck. This microtalk aims to identify a few key elements that amplify the joy, and common design pitfalls to avoid.\r\n        "},

Now, the advisory board of the Free-to-Play Summit is proud to revive this GDC tradition, with a free-to-play focused version of the Challenge. Four free-to-play designers will have been given marching orders, and tasked with designing a game around that given problem. All four will present their idea to the Summit audience, followed by an audience vote. Innovative thinking and lively presentations are in store for all attendees!The theme of this year's Challenge is \"Designing for Minnows\". Free-to-play games are almost always tuned to extract most of their revenue from \"whales\" -- those super-fans of the game who spend the big bucks, while the other 99.9% of the game's players spend little or nothing on it. We've challenged three free-to-play designers to come up with a design for a game that will extract the vast majority of it's revenue not from \"whales\" but from \"minnows\"... players who, over their entire lifetime, spend $10 or less. Come see what our challengers have come up with, and then help vote for the winner!\r\n        "},

The more real-time the data is, the more timely the decisions we can make. However, this also poses a higher challenge to our data accuracy. When there are abnormal data fluctuations, we need to immediately judge whether it is the abnormal behavior in the game or the abnormality in the data pipeline. In the development practice of ThunderFire UX, we have established a complete data exception monitoring system to monitor every aspect that may go wrong, whether it is the problem of the real-time system itself or the exception of the game service. Through our system, we can quickly troubleshoot the abnormal stage, so as to quickly evaluate the time taken for the system to return to normal. In this speech, in addition to showing the audience how to build this system, we will also show the audience how this system finds various exceptions in practice, such as exceptions in network transmission, exceptions in the task scheduling systems, and exceptions in-game service itself. By listening to this speech, both data engineers, data analysts, QA, SA, and game programmers can quickly apply the ideas of this system to their own game projects and quickly troubleshoot the problems in the game.\r\n        "},

These systems free up space on the game's main server to perform additional operations, allowing players to better interact with each other and their surroundings.nnThis session explores why CCP is using gRPC as a solution to enhance EVE Online's massive player battles, how gRPC works within EVE's server architecture, and the opportunities this independent domain service structure provides for server stability and maintenance.\r\n        "},

Ido Yehieli ( Stellar Cartography Interactive UG) will share the challenges of adapting game jam ideas and principles to full-time development. Keith Burgun (Dinofarm Games) reflects on how many years to come to terms with the fact that 'these genres might just not fit that well together'. Finally, Dave Proctor (Mighty Yell Studios) will offer us a new lens to view 'success' and 'failure' beyond just sales numbers.I Had to Abandon My Game After 4 Years And It Nearly Broke MeAdrn Novell, (Game Designer, Electronic Arts)Shared knowledge and experiences after 4+ years of developing an indie game, tried everything to make it work and still failed. How being naive, South American and young game developer lead us to make a mistake after the other.Not Every Busker Can Play at the Orchestra Ido Yehieli, (CEO, Stellar Cartography Interactive UG)In 2012 I took part of \"indie buskers\" - a group of indies taking ideas from the audience and live streaming a game jam over a weekend (for \"pay as you wish\" support from people viewing the stream). The resulting game of that jam was very popular, raised a bunch of money from viewers & I decided \"if I made *that* in a weekend I'll bet I can make something really amazing from it in a few months!\".The talk is about why that didn't happen, and at the end of 3 months I ended up with a game barely any different than the original weekend jam game. It sold very little of mobile, I couldn't get a flash sponsorship for the web version. It didn't recoup even the modest amount of money I invested into extending it these few months (a lot less than the original buskers version did).Escape the Omnochronom!Keith Burgun, (Game Designer, Keith Burgun Games)In 2018, a strange and mysterious game appeared on Steam: Escape the Omnochronom! A weird turn-based combination of rogue-likes and MOBAs, with a dark, bizarre setting. The story behind the highly experimental game -- and why it did not work -- is an interesting one that includes a number of important lessons, particularly for solo indie devs like Escape the Omnochronom's creator, Keith Burgun. What was it that made this game not work? When do you decide to pull the plug on an idea, particularly in the world of strategy games where things are often not fun until a game comes together?The Real Failures Were Plans We Made Along The WayDave Proctor, (Director, Mighty Yell Studios)If you can believe it, sometimes a game isn't an earth-shattering global number one hit on day one. We can plan and project and prognosticate our desired outcome, but as the landscape of how we sell games changes, so too must our expectations. Dave Proctor was game director on The Big Con, and while the game is far from a failure, he wants to talk about everything that went wrong. Also, as it becomes harder and harder to understand the randomness of the market, how do we define what real failure is and what lessons we can really learn from it?\r\n        "},

Publishers can provide much needed funding, production and marketing support, as well as providing access to a community of players for your game. However, any publishing agreement is by default likely to weigh in the publisher's favour. Following on from Contract Killers: Episode1 (2021) I will continue to look at those provisions that can sometimes be used by publishers to negatively impact a developer, explain in-depth about what certain clauses actually mean in practice, and hopefully give you some confidence heading into a negotiation that it is ok to ask for certain clauses to be changed before you sign on the dotted line.\r\n        "},

Forged together by their common enterprise of enlisting active empathy within their audience or player, video games and theatre serve as the two most powerful devices for bringing up visceral emotion in those who encounter it.

At the core of Elsinore's flexibility was its narrative simulation engine, which allowed the game to dynamically respond to all sorts of player actions in surprising ways. However, such systems never come without complications. nnUsing specific examples, this talk will dive into how Elsinore's narrative and simulation elements were woven together, the advantages of this approach, and how it could be applied to other games. It will also explore all the ways these systems can go wrong, the way these complications manifest, and how the Elsinore team tackled these issues.\r\n        "}
