Many board game designers enter the industry with preconceived notions about fun, games, and play, based on their gaming pasts. Some revel in the conflict and drama of social deduction games, for example, while others prefer the solitary planning of low-interaction Euros. These preferences come with powerful biases that shape board game design tendencies, often subconsciously. The truth is, there is no wrong way to enjoy games. Preferences and biases are unavoidable; however, designers who develop an appreciation of the diverse forms that game enjoyment can take are better able to create innovative and deeply satisfying play experiences. This talk from board game designer & podcaster Emma Larkins utilizes practical and philosophical categorization of play experiences to allow designers to find paths for uniquely delightful play."},

This talk will explain what a dialogue stub is, including the information that does (and does not) belong in it. It will cover best practices for stubbing as well as the pitfalls that arise from uninformative or overly detailed stubs. By the end, attendees will understand how to get the most from dialogue stubbing workflows on their own teams."},

More than twenty years late, reality shows do not reach the rating high they did in 2000, but they still have a surprising amount of staying power. While there is very little work around the game design of competitive reality shows, we can learn a lot from the strategic gameplay, emergent narrative and complex play experience they provide. As the game industry is pivoting toward creating games that allow players more agency and freedom, game developers struggle to create compelling experiences without complete control over how they will be played. Reality shows, games with simple rules and complex emergent mechanics might be one answer for designing those experiences. Those games are repayable, still relevant, and provide a different experience every time they are played."},

Lethal, precise, fast but how does that translate into gameplay and combat balance? Honoring this fantasy, most importantly lethality of the blade, was a major challenge in making Ghost of Tsushima's combat. nnWhile assassinations and standoffs nailed it, applying lethality to standard combat was more difficult. This talk will go over the multitude of attempts to try to solve this problem. Additionally, it will provide a behind the scenes look at the data-driven approach to game balance and design details of how it all came together."},

Luckily, level designers and environment artists have the opportunity to learn valuable lessons from these more experienced disciplines. This talk will leverage cognitive science, anthropological, and urbanism research to explore what it means to get lost and how spaces can be designed to prevent this from happening. By identifying elements in the built environment that contribute to more comprehensive cognitive maps, developers can start creating virtual environments that are more navigable, memorable, and less likely to disorient players.\r\n        "},

From modest beginnings in the 80s and 90s we have reached the point where we simulate and display complex light-matter, optical, motion and physics interactions. As hardware and techniques used become more sophisticated, we must also pay more attention to how generated visuals are to be perceived and interpreted by human visual system. It is important for several reasons: Human visual system, while effective, is not technically accurate and may lead to misperceptions of hues, light intensities, sizes and shapes as well as general attentional misperceptions. Understanding human visual system better may help alleviating these issues but also to help developing more computationally efficient algorithms that maximize what is important for human vision and minimize what is less likely to be perceived. The talk will overview the modern understanding of human visual system, such as hue, intensity, shape and motion perception and discuss specific implication on camera design, anti-aliasing, lighting and global illumination techniques."},

Early concept art and design indicated that the vehicles that populated these spaces would be vast in number, highly detailed and would play a vital role in telling the story of decay that is synonymous with the Last of Us universe. Accurate and detailed depiction of vehicles in previous Naughty Dog video games required significant texture allocation per asset and employed traditional baking methods. The vehicle creation pipeline was time consuming, requiring highly skilled artistry at each stage and due to level texture memory limitations, was limited in scale. This session will discuss a new approach that not only improved upon the quality and variation of the vehicle assets, but that was also faster to implement and could be scaled with far less impact on memory limitations."},

Using examples and results from Madden and FIFA, where this technology has been applied, the session focuses on enhancements and solutions built to meet growing demands. The concept of passive interaction participation is covered, allowing characters and locators to interchangeably serve as reference points for interactions; enabling context-based single character animations, interactions with the environment, and even interactions with future intercept positions of moving objects. The session also delves into two approaches to integrating motion matching with multi-character interaction, without loss of player control; using single character motion matching to improve believability of transitions into multi-character animations as well as synchronized multi-character motion matching.\r\n        "},

A popular method for decimating a mesh is the Garland-Heckbert algorithm. This approach uses edge contractions to reduce the number of triangles. The maximum error of the decimated mesh is bounded by a so-called quadric error metric (QEM). In this talk, properties of QEMs are discussed. We show what causes issues when using QEMs to find positions for newly created vertices and how to improve mesh quality. We show how to choose the new vertex positions conservatively, i.e. such that the decimated mesh either completely encapsulates the original mesh for the purpose of collision detection, or is completely encapsulated by the original mesh for the purpose of occlusion culling. Performance tweaks and termination criteria are addressed, and trade-offs are discussed."},

Jackbox Games will unbox the process that goes into making a Jackbox Party Pack and answer some of your most pressing questions about the franchise: Where do all these game ideas come from? How are games chosen to be in the party pack? What does the iteration and testing process look like? Why do some games like Trivia Murder Party and Push the Button take years to make it into a Party Pack while others breeze into production. How have things changed between Party Pack 1 and Party Pack 8? Come to think of it, why are you even making a pack of games in the first place? Why not just make one game at a time? How can I find love? Not sure if we'll make it to that last one, but definitely all the others."},

Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) is a macro theory of human motivation that emerged from research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and identifies three universal psychological needs that, if satisfied, enable optimal function and growth: competence, autonomy and relatedness. In this talk, Alexandre Moufarek discusses how SDT can help build intrinsically motivated teams that sustainably show a high-level of performance and find great satisfaction in their work. \"Happy game developers make happy gamers\" is not just a saying.

The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions such as prioritization, focusing attention, making decisions, initiating action, and inhibiting inappropriate actions. Mindfulness is simply paying complete attention to the present moment without judgment. So why do it? Because a growing mountain of scientific evidence suggests that mindfulness and meditation: Improves self-control and emotional regulation, reduces stress and increase happiness, and improves your ability to focus in an extremely distracting world. In this highly interactive workshop, you'll try several forms of mindfulness, including meditation techniques that can be immediately applied in a busy day leading game development. You will leave with a more powerful inner CEO, and the ability to bring mindfulness to your biggest game development challenges.\r\n        "},

The game has been very well received by players and critics (98% positive Steam reviews, 4.8/5 average rating on Oculus Store and is now the 24th best rated PS4 title of 2020 according to Metacritic, with a metascore of 82). To achieve a compelling level of illusion and immersion, there have been many factors that ARVORE has had to consider when creating this project. One of the main factors that made the game outstand among other VR games from the very beginning has been its ability to strongly connect with the emotional moments from many gamers' childhoods. That's why in this talk, the ARVORE Immersive Experiences team will tell which elements based on affective memories contributed to increase the immersion in the Pixel Ripped games. For that, they will detail about the different aspects of the game and how they affected the final production: game design, narrative, art direction and sound design."},

Additionally, developers need to consider the requirements of two very different stakeholders - namely, learners and educators - while considering aspects such as fast onboarding, scalability in classrooms environments, security, and safety. This talk discusses lessons learned from developing the interactive VR learning platform \"Maroon\", which is currently introduced and evaluated in highschools. The talk will mainly analyze the challenges of designing, prototyping, and implementing an educational VR experience for learning STEM fields (such as physics) under significant budget and workflow constraints and discusses first experiences integrating such a platform in a classroom environment and iterating design workflows with young students in developing such an experience."},

Osama will also share the stories and experiences of other notable video game professionals, both AAA and Indie, who have similarly sourced their own lives and personal stories when crafting their games.Part 2: Kind Words: Why Be Nice? (Ziba Scott)Being nice isn't the sexiest game mechanic -- nothing explodes and there's no reason to wear cool body armor. So how did Popcannibal convince players to send each other four million uplifting messages? Ziba Scott will share the leap of faith in humanity that birthed Kind Words, and the limits required because humans are messy.Part 3: 'Valuing Inclusive Game Design' (Lyndsay Pearson)Video gamers of today are more diverse than ever before. To begin tapping into the future of the market, it's becoming increasingly important to design games that appeal to a broad audience of players from all backgrounds and cultures. In this talk Lyndsay Pearson will cover how inclusiveness impacts our games, why it's important to grow inclusive culture in our workplaces, and how The Sims has evolved the franchise to reflect this trend.\r\n        "},

The term, coined by Clint Hocking, refers to how actions a player takes during gameplay (Ludo) often don't line up with the story (Narrative) the game is trying to tell. nnThere has and always will be a chasm between the tools and mechanics used to challenge players and achieve fun and those narrative techniques necessary to setup environments and characters to craft a quality story. Most AAA games solve this by masterfully advancing plot and character during cut-scenes that occur between bouts of twitchy gameplay involving an avatar that happens to look just like the story's protagonist.nnIn free-to-play games, trying to roll out meaningful and connected story elements often becomes even more dissonant. In F2P, the gameplay structures, the system math, and the gating of content is designed around the player's immediate compulsion and continual long-term retention, often with unpredictable cadence and length of sessions -- some as short as one minute.nnIn good storytelling, world-building and character-building are done at a deliberate, careful rate where the writer carefully doles out bits and pieces to advance a plot and keep the audience engaged and surprised. It's why storytelling is usually done in a linear fashion on proven timetables such as the 30-minute sitcom or 90-minute three-act screenplay.nnIn free to play, the usual method to monetize is to charge players to speed systems up... So time itself is always exaggerated, either hyper-slowed or hyper-sped-up. Many free to play games also offer non-linear choice to try to keep players engaged, gating and surfacing clear short, medium- and long-term goals and allowing different types of players to arrange their gameplay around their level of general mastery and how much free time they have each day to check in and play. nnTrying to have the game goals advance both the math model and a cohesive narrative model is pretty much impossible to do well. nnAnd yet, some people have pulled it off.nnLooking at examples of hits and misses, we'll try to play Goldilocks and articulate the \"just right\" amount of narrative to make free to play successful.nnOn the plus side:nnGardenscapes and its Ilk: How a sprinkle of narrative revitalized the Match-Three category. nIdle Games: How games like Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money figured out how to gate narrative via small bite-size \"episodes\", using it to structure levels, drive events, and actually increase monetization beyond the point when a player may have gotten bored by the mathy mechanics alone.nObvious wins like Episodes and Choices which really are hella light on interactivity and mainly pure narrative with light branching.nnAnd on the negative side:nnTelltale's experimentation with free to play on mobile and why it utterly failed. nHyper-casual titles trying to deepen themselves with meaningful story and pretend they are anything beyond a cynical exercise in rewarded-ad arbitrage and existential compulsion. \r\n        "},

In this session, some demos using Semantic ML will be presented, showing how it can be used to quickly prototype and craft an AI and its personality using just a simple spreadsheet.

The animations involve lip and chin, upper facial expression (eyebrows, upper and bottom eyelids, and eyeballs), head rotation, torso and hand gestures, and legs and feet. The synthesized animations can reflect speech prosody, express the emotional state expressed by speech and correspond to specific personalities and professions of NPCs. Without any manual intervention, it takes only less than 500ms to compute full-body animation trajectories for an utterance which lasts about 5 to 20 seconds. The automatic animation generator allows animators or artists to be released from manually creating animations and processing motion capture data."},

In NetEase Games, we built a custom 3D parametric face model, around which, we developed a series of techniques for 3D facial content-creation and in-game applications. This session will introduce what is and how to build such a 3D parametric face model, and give implementation details to three techniques built upon this model, i.e., creating face meshes from images, producing shape and expression variations from one example face mesh, and facial performance capture."},

Deep reinforcement learning can be a great approach because a developer can articulate the desired objectives or goals and have the machines learn the best behavior.

However, there are new advancements in cooperative DRL tools, such as centralized critic, that can be leveraged to create cooperative character behaviors in a game. In this presentation, we will go over these topics and illustrate a real-life example of a studio using deep reinforcement learning to create cooperative characters in their game."},

While much can be accomplished using individuals, having multi-character interactions provides a richer experience. This talk will present in detail the aLiVE Group Behaviour System, a highly modular AI architecture developed at Ubisoft Toronto. This system allows for the creation of highly reactive group behaviours, used in Watch Dogs: Legion to author ID checks, extortions, crime events, hostage scenarios, protest groups, and police interactions. When the player interacts with these scenes, the group behaviour system can properly consider the group context and roles of participants to react in realistic and interesting ways.\r\n        "},

Instead of testing a part of a game, or have a bot play a level for an amount of time, we developed a system that plays entire games from start to finish like a player would. In this talk we do a deep dive into this framework and explore how it combines an Numeric Domain Independent AI Planning system with classical techniques, like behaviours trees. We will discuss how we managed the complexity of the system and the helpful impact it has had on game development. We will showcase this system playing a variety of games from different genres, including: 3rd person shooters (Zombie Army 4, Sniper Elite) and a lair-management game (Evil Genius 2).\r\n        "},

However, the HTN systems have no mechanism to handle accidental changes or hostile agent behavior. When using the HTN systems in games where the situation changes in real time, conventional games have dealt with this by increasing the frequency of \"replanning,\" which is the process of remaking the plan. In many cases, this resulted in destroying the long-term thinking of the AI. For this reason, we have developed ART-HTN, an evolution of the HTN system that is more suitable for real-time games.

This talk will start at the Publisher's terms sheet and touch on a variety of topics that surface during the negotiation process. This includes IP ownership, revenue share, recoupment, and helping bring more contract-focused topics to the term sheet level (such as building workable milestones and addressing what happens if things go sideways)."},

Yet, game developers tend to rely on a single predictive model to segment and understand their players. TENTUPLAY breaks from the norm by building multiple empirically proven models that each correspondingly map distinct behavioral tendencies of players. Such approach overhauls existing drawbacks in single modeling paradigm by yielding adaptive and comprehensive player analytics. Multi-model analysis systematically identifies the most suitable models to employ for each game genre and its lifecycle stage. The models then analyze player behavior throughout their journey from D1 to synthetically reveal the reasoning behind their churn and purchase. Understanding these individual retention and consumption behavior is integral to leveraging further engagement with hyper-personalizing gaming experience for each player. This session dives deeper into the evidence of multi-model's advantage and how it is substantively implemented to encourage more purchase and longer play time.\r\n        "},

(Seriously, where you've been the last 20 years?). The real questions are - 'Why make people cry?''How do we make players love, laugh, despise, sympathise, or empathise instead...?' and 'How do developers ensure players feel the right emotions?' Getting players to connect with a game's setting, narrative, or characters provides more than artistic reward, it can add millions to a game's income. But, while videogames have a track record of making players feel scared, thrilled, or titillated, the industry's emotional palette is still small. This practical session looks at existing models of 'Press Y to cry', 'X to shag', or 'O to ponder the existential nature of the universe', and explores a range of other models and solutions for how to deepen emotion during gameplay. Come and share the love (hate, jealousy, trust, joy, etc).\r\n        "},
