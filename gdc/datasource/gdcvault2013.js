By looking at particular case studies from the history of early and casual games, Fortugno will make a case that while testing and metrics are critical to a game's success, design needs to be an inventive and freewheeling part of the development process for both the aesthetic quality of a game, and for the financial health of the industry as a whole.\r\n        "},

This talk challenges us to break free of audio as part of a \"post-production\" world. We'll highlight some of the unique and innovative audio developments of the past decade where the audio has turned around the equation, and instead been a key \"pre-production\" component, driving the implementation rather than the other way around. While some of the illustrations will be well known, others include tricks and tips not seen since their initial demonstrations, challenging us to continue to push on that fourth wall and provide sound that not only matches the visuals, but provides surprises to the user."},

This talk will explain the process of evolving the soundtrack from the original 2007 mod, which was built using only digital samples, to the remake's lush orchestration. The talk will focus on how to create rich and deep soundtracks on a tight budget, and our process of design, placement, and optimization of the music as a device to focus the player's emotional journey. The talk will begin by explaining the compositional philosophy of Dear Esther's music (finalist in Excellence in Audio at the IGF 2012), and how this related to the vision and design of the game, from story to environment art. This will feed into a discussion of the compositional process itself, particularly, the fusion of digital samples, effects, and live instrumentation. The relationship between music and environmental audio, including the use of quirky and strange semi-musical audio cues that offset the landscape and soundtrack, will be explored, as well as how distortions, splices, and manipulations can bring a unique tone and flavor to game music. The talk will conclude with thoughts, based on the experience of Dear Esther and other thechineseroom games, on how composers can communicate with developers and designers, and vice versa. The success of Dear Esther is frequently ascribed to the deep, holistic fusion of art, story, and music. This core of the talk is how this was achieved, and how studios can create powerful, integrated scores, even on a low budget.\r\n        "},

However, until the world outside gamers accepts the concept, it will never be considered as an art form to the masses. Does it really matter?

An audio texture can be described as a sound having a somewhat random character, but a recognizable quality. For instance, the sounds of water flowing, a vehicle engine, or a fire burning are textures. Software has been built for the generation of audio textures given a small sample. Much more of a given sound can be created, and the sound created will not be a simple repetition of the sample. This method has been extended to generate sound effects from examples, which are not textures, and will lead to less repetition in the audio track of a game. This method somewhat resembles granular synthesis, and uses methods related to those used by graphics researchers to generate visual textures from example images. To oversimplify, small sound samples are recombined in a new order, piecing them together in a way that maximizes the similarity where they meet, at the beginning and end of the blocks. The extension of sound effects is accomplished by fitting an appropriate envelope to the sound, and using texture generation for each section of the signal.

In this talk, Spelunky XBLA programmer Andy Hull draws on 5 years of experience working as a wooden toy designer to examine how wooden toys seek to create immersive, engaging, and complete experiences using limited resources. Explore what design solutions game developers can borrow specifically from toy design, and see examples of games that already do. Genre and Creativity in Indie Development (James Lantz, Independent) James Lantz will discuss how to change the way you think about genre in order to make truly experimental games. His talk will incorporate interviews with creative indie developers, psychological science, and his own perspective. James will talk about how genre can hold us back from, or push us toward, being truly experimental, and how we can change this. Lessons in Creativity Learned from The Stanley Parable (Davey Wreden, Galactic Cafe) Creativity is elusive, hard to define, and harder to capture. Davey Wreden, creator of The Stanley Parable, offers a simple and concise set of rules that allow us to define creativity more precisely. Through historical examples and personal anecdotes from development of The Stanley Parable, he investigates how these rules serve as building blocks to more deeply elicit the creative spirit in any artistically-minded professional."},

Umbra's solution eliminates the need for manual markups typically associated with polygon soups. It allows loose construction of game worlds instead of highly restrictive and technical process of constructing well formed, water-tight geometry. The automatically created spatial database can be used for reasoning about space, not only to perform occlusion culling but also to solve other problems such as 3D path finding, audio propagation and even lighting. This approach is vital in the creation of Bungie's next universe and its unparalleled gaming experience, which is why Umbra 3 is a key component in Destiny. Takeaway: Umbra has developed a new approach for solving visibility and performing occlusion culling. In this talk Umbra and Bungie discuss the requirements for the visibility system and content creation in Destiny, and how the key problems were solved."},

This lecture discusses how to efficiently implement collision detection, particles, and rigid body simulation executed on the GPU. Although OpenCL is taught, most information is applicable to CUDA and DirectCompute. For each stage in the particle and rigid body simulation pipeline, we will discuss the suitability of popular algorithms for GPU. This includes collision detection, contact generation and contact reduction for convex and concave triangle meshes, contact constraint setup, and solving. You can expect to simulate up to hundred thousand active rigid bodies with stable stacking in real-time on modern GPUs.

Usually, these occluded objects are submitted to the GPU for rendering, only to have their pixels rejected by the z-buffer later in the pipeline. We will show you how to improve performance by lowering the computational cost of occluded objects. Our technique divides scene objects into two groups: occluders and occludes, and uses a software rasterizer to draw the occluders to a depth buffer. Then we test each occludee for occlusion by rasterizing its bounding box against this depth buffer. Performance improves further by reducing the number of processed occluders and occludees with frustum culling. We also optimized it with SSE and multi-threading. On a 2.3GHz 3rd Gen Intel Core Processor (Ivy Bridge) system with Intel HD 3000 graphics, software occlusion culling achieves up to 8X performance speedup compared to a non-culled display of the sample scene.\r\n        "},

However, efforts toward photorealistic character rendering are futile if they don't include subsurface scattering rendering (SSS), realistic eye shading, physically based rendering, depth of field, film grain, plausible bloom, film-like tone mapping, very detailed assets, soft shadows, and an accurate anti-aliasing solution. Failing on any of these means the illusion of looking at a real human will be broken. This presentation will cover our techniques for SSS, eye shading, anti-aliasing, depth of field, and film grain, as well as presenting the integration issues being solved for our game studios. This talk will also present our computer vision techniques for character asset capture from video, and fitting the dense captured and tracked data to game rigs via energy minimization. Such asset capture increases the level of character quality, which requires more advanced rendering techniques so as not to fall in the uncanny valley. The talk will show high-quality next-generation shading driven with a plausible game rig. Ultimately, our goal is to overcome the uncanny valley with next-gen run-time techniques and good artistic direction. This is for us, the first step toward achieving truly believable characters.\r\n        "},

Health Recovery: From Regenerative Damage Shields to potion dilution, where potions become less effective as you drink them, many different health recovery mechanisms were tried. What were the major issues with each of these systems and how did it lead to health globes in the end? 2. Controls. At Blizzard, control is king.  Although simple on the surface, a number of iterations were required to polish the Diablo III interface, in order to provide the player with tight and responsive controls. 3. Skill System: The skill system underwent multiple revisions. Early systems involved different variations of point spending, an evolution from Diablo II. Later systems had runes, with multiple rune ranks that dropped as items, which could be used to modify skills.\r\n        "},

Mark of the Ninja adapted stealth gameplay to side-scrolling 2D, but the means to do this were often counterintuitive. Rather than emulating genre tropes, Mark of the Ninja was derived from understanding the true appeal of stealth games (player-centric design allowing for gameplay choice), and used these principles to adapt stealth games to a new perspective.

But why is it so powerful and lasting as an idea? My argument is that it's not just about the heroic kick of saving the world, but it's the best example of how story and gameplay dovetail together. In the apocalypse, we find the perfect fusion of content and mechanics. By using a series of case studies, I will demonstrate how a powerful and well-honed story/setting can support and vastly enhance gameplay. By understanding the power of apocalyptic themes and structures, we can build better scenarios with a more integrated relationship between story and gameplay, which will lead to better games.\r\n        "},

First a few, then many, running from the apocalypse that core games were sure to become. We passed around money hats and congratulated ourselves on reaching the future. However, some years in, the horizon we craved is miles away, and the shore is an endlessly running treadmill of design retreads, sporadic mega-hits, and spam. Where there were once mechanics, there are now marketing patterns. Where there was innovation, copies. Players became users, play merely became service, and great designers pushed out what they were told. Some left companies, and even the industry, dissuaded by what it had become. Others remained, silently fighting behind the scenes for something that satisfied their soul, the old soul - the one that drew them here in the first place.

The game's editor allowed players to construct their own virtual pinball tables, and players could save these tables to disk and trade them with friends. The editor's clean and simple interface even served as inspiration to designs behind SimCity six years later. Construction Set eventually grew into a series, with music, adventure, and racing themes for sequels. Bill Budge, the father of the seminal Pinball entry, will lay out the blueprints for how he constructed his own game and one of the earliest examples of an in-game editor.\r\n        "},

Over the last year, we have simplified it to focus exclusively on the 8 facets that seem to be primary for gaming, found a place for Neuroticism/Threat (last year's mystery), and have streamlined the whole thing to include a complete set of player archetypes (and the games they would play) for each set of facets. Easier to remember, easier to master, confusions removed, etc. That's cool, but how do we apply such a thing to game development? The speaker believes that the answer to that question for this model (and every other psychological model for that matter) is simply this: developing accurate empathy. Fun fact: accurate empathy makes for better game developers and thus better games!\r\n        "},

For African audiences, video games are only a new medium to play what has already existed for centuries before. A video game developer in Africa must be able to design across the cultural boundaries, and educate the player in using new interactive technologies. There has been tremendous growth in mobile technology and the number of mobile users, so mobile phones have become the most popular gaming platform. However, political issues have affected many communities on the continent, which has led to any media, such as newspapers, television, and radio, being sensitive about the content they release to the public. Video games are no exception to this rule, and thus game creators must be careful about the themes and ideas behind their games. Sharing over 7 years of experience as game developers in Africa, the speakers will present an overview of the African market and the emerging landscape for game development."},

Some educators, while superbly qualified in the technical areas that they teach, lack sufficient understanding and insight into these legal and business issues when trying to prepare their students for successful careers in our industry. Today's broader range of accessible distribution platforms for smaller games make the possibility of any student embarking on a successful career via a micro studio a reality. It is not uncommon for a school project to turn into a successful game, or even a successful franchise. Being aware of the applicable intellectual property issues, and their impact early in the educational process, will make education fuller and more relevant to the students, and more rewarding for the educators. Some institutions seek to protect their students from the perils of running afoul of various intellectual property issues through the premature involvement in the commercial aspects of development, by securing the ownership rights for all student projects submitted for grades. This, and other issues related to institutional intellectual property ownership policies, and how they impact students' efforts to bring their school projects into the marketplace, can complicate or impair possible career paths for students.

In the 18th century, the popularization of the novel was met with fear and derision (\"depraved, foolish, yet dangerous books,\" one critic wrote of them). In the 1920s, the popularization of the crossword puzzle lit up the same embers of fear: idle wastes of time keeping citizens from work and family duties. Some game developers and players  seem to believe that this problem will just go away on its own over time. But recent events should remind us that we can't just wait around for games to improve their own reputation in public life, because it won't happen. In this session, three experienced and opinionated public advocates for videogames will characterize the true nature of games' public image problem and offer concrete, short- and long-term strategies and tactics for improving the public image of games, useful to game developers no matter their role, project, or experience.\r\n        "},

Environments also became richer and more dynamic, which made manual markup and scripting labor-intensive and brittle, and required more sophisticated techniques for world analysis.

The second portion of the session will present methods to gracefully scale down AI systems as needs change.
