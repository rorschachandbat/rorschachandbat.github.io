The explorer lab takes low income middle school students on a field trip to Mars, and is custom-tailored to measurably activate interest in STEM. IDEO, in collaboration with Whiskytree and West Coast Customs, crafted the explorer lab from scratch to pilot in 9 months. This talk will showcase the application of IDEO's human-centered design approach to game and software development. Specific methods for tackling educational objectives in games (i.e. imparting real science through Martian rover engineering), for reaching a range of students from those who can barely read to those three grades above average, and for designing interaction modalities on a new hardware/software platform will be discussed."},

Everyone reacts differently to these sorts of stress but there's one thing everyone has in common: it makes creativity almost impossible. If you're fundamentally broken, your creative work is fundamentally broken too. Making great games means making ourselves whole again. This talk comes from personal experience, going through multiple rounds of cancer now deemed incurable. It provides tools to recognize when you're deep in the well of darkness, and methods to help reclaim your creativity. Whether you're able to make the arduous climb out of the well or you must find beauty in a journey spent largely in darkness, you can move forward. You can create again. But first comes forgiveness."},

This talk will explain the specific design of the currency, its faucets and drains and exchange methods. It'll also tell you about the technology the Crimson team used, so you can set one up yourself."},

To meet their vision of a vast open world filled with narrative-driven quests, studio leadership identified early in production that a new group of designers would be necessary to supplement Guerrilla's existing design expertise. Blake Rebouche, Senior Quest Designer at Guerrilla Games, was hired in 2015 to be part of that new team and bring his experience to the development of 'Horizon Zero Dawn'. In this session, Blake will explain through his own experiences and anecdotes what it was like finding a happy medium between the systems-driven content of open-world RPGs like 'The Elder Scrolls' and the action focused level design of games like Guerrilla's own 'Killzone'."},

Nintendo's Kosuke Yabuki, who directed 'Mario Kart 7' and 'Mario Kart 8' and served as producer on both 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe' and 'ARMS', will talk about the challenges of creating a genre-bending fighting game for a brand-new platform. What lessons can a kart-racer offer a brawler that has players throwing corkscrew punches like tennis players volleying missiles? How do you ensure function follows form, using the Nintendo Switch system's motion controls in ways that feel as natural and responsive as tapping buttons? And what's the story behind a world where protagonists' fists come unglued from their forearms anyway?\r\n        "}

However, the concept of character storytelling by AI is still new and challenging. Game design, AI architecture design, and emotional experience design call for different expertise, but are all needed to create a living, experience-engaging AI-buddy, especially in a big and complicated open world game such as 'Final Fantasy XV'. In this talk speaker Prasert \"Sun\" Prasertvithyakarn will share with how he and his team at Square Enix combined these three designs to bring their three AI-buddies Prompto, Gladiolus and Ignis to life, pioneering the field, and searching for new approaches for the next generation to come."},

Many methods exist to compute indirect specular (reflection), however all of the currently used techniques have many issues with image stability, floating reflections, missing reflection anisotropy, etc. This session will share how 2K games implemented a hybrid screen-space and cube-map array tracing for 'Mafia III'. This method combined importance sampling with large screen-space blur. It addressed floating reflections and image stability as SSR/CM blend was seamless but didn't produce proper material response and introduced leaking on high-roughness materials. This talk will present an improved version that eliminates the large screen-space blur with smart sample distribution, spatio-temporal filter, screen and CM pre-filtering.

The traditional approach to animation transitions involves blending between the old source animation state and the new target animation state; however this can have a significant performance cost, because one must evaluate both the source and target animation states during a transition, effectively doubling the animation evaluation cost. For 'Gears of War 4', Microsoft eliminated these blended transitions altogether and chose to instead handle motion transitions as a post-process with a technique called \"inertialization\". Eliminating these blended transitions gave them a significant performance boost because they no longer needed to evaluate multiple animation states during the transition. In this talk, David Bollo presents the mathematics behind Microsoft's inertialization technique, for both vector and quaternion values, and show how it can be easily introduced into an existing game engine."},

After trying a number of approaches, from optimizing traditional A* as much as possible to implementing different hierarchical and heuristic schemes, the Sauropod Studio team developed a very efficient and straightforward approach that visits an average of 100 to 1000 times less nodes than its non-hierarchical counterparts.

A common problem facing games that use sprite animations is the amount of texture memory each frame uses, and this is a particularly serious constraint on mobile devices. To solve this, sprite packing and atlasing can be used to more efficiently make use of memory, but these solutions can lead to wasted space in atlases that can't be completely filled. Grabthar's Hammer is a tool the Secret Lab team wrote for the mobile port of 'Night in the Woods' that solves this problem in a more efficient way, by using sprite dicing to maximize atlas usage with minimal wastage. This session will present the technique, discuss how 'Night in the Woods' was adapted to use it, and how sprite dicing techniques can be taken further by using techniques from the world of video compression to get the largest number of sprites out of your memory budget."},

Understanding the characteristics and performance of units is key for many steps during the development process: from design, to AI decision-making, and as a supporting layer if combat between sets of units is simulated. Creative Assembly developed a new approach that relies on the mathematical principle of Taylor expansion: instead of trying to identify the accurate performance value of a unit in a specific situation, they linearize its performance around a baseline value within the situational space of their game. Therein, they use game model results to determine modifiers for different situational dimensions of their game (e.g. terrain, units involved) and linearize a unit's contextual potential around its base value by using these modifier values.This lecture will discuss the caveats that come with this approach and investigate its application for game design, AI, and on automatic battle resolution algorithm.\r\n        "},

This can be something that is apparent to the player, something that is only visible to the other devs around you, or might be something that only lives under the hood, known only to you. The common thread is that it is something that makes you ask, \"why doesn't everyone do this?\" This will be a rapid-fire series of presenters sharing something they have discovered and used over the years.

They need tools that can automatically fill up a large space, as well as allow fine tuning of smaller locations.

Rather than use methods seen in VFX, Yibing will show how Unity took methods from AAA game production that pushed the visual bar while being real-time.On Cultures of Shared Creative Ownership (Andrew Maximov, Naughty Dog Inc.)What if someone told you that dedicated management could be optional for creative production teams of all kinds of sizes? Can developers self organize and ship products without absolute and utter chaos destroying the production? The answer is \"sometimes\". It is very hard. It requires some very fundamental cultural shifts. But it has been proven to work, bringing you some of the most celebrated video game titles and earning hundreds of millions of dollars at the same time.

This is demonstrated through overviews and technical demonstrations of a scalable asset system, a rigging-on-demand framework as well as a mechanism to completely abstract tool code from the rigs, or rig metadata, they operate on. All of which come together to produce a pipeline which actively promotes experimentation and progression."},

This talk in based upon the experience Stray Fawn Studio gained from their games 'Niche' (a genetics survival game) and 'Nimbatus: The Space Drone Constructor'. Topics include exhibiting your game, crowdfunding, social media, indie dev collectives, cross-promotion, and Steam Early Access."},

If you're an indie, there's a really good chance that you began your studio because you wanted to make games, not necessarily because you wanted to manage people or run a business. Making games is fun. All that other stuff? Not so much. To make things even more challenging, most indies have to figure all of this out without having a production, marketing or business development person around to help ease the pain. In this talk, Amy Dallas will discuss several issues she and her team encountered as they transitioned from working in large corporate environments to working for themselves as a small under-resourced indie studio."},

The specifics of the role is different each time but in all cases they are entrusted to steer the ship and they know more than anyone about what on earth is going on. They are the conduit between all of the different teams, stake holders and relationships. They are the person that needs to manage all of those factions for a project to be produced and it is an art form in itself. In this 2 part session you will get to hear about and discuss techniques and tips for working as a producer; managing up (publishers, execs, clients and bosses) and managing down (internal teams, external dev teams. outsourcers and services). Brynley Gibson and Sitara Shefta will discuss how you can build an adaptive framework that is right for your situation as no two projects are the same. Using real life examples based on multiple projects of different sizes and needs, this session will compress and share years of experience into practical ideas and best practice techniques.Brynley and Sitara will touch on the different aspects of the producers role: the creative, the project management, the negotiator and the councilor, and how those different hats can be best utilized when managing in different directions. The session will be split into two parts. In the first half, Brynley and Sitara will discuss best practices for managing up and managing down. The second half of the session will be run as a workshop, in which attendees will have an opportunity to detail a production problem on their project, which they will then discuss in groups and offer solutions/advice."},

How do you avoid losing creativity and the human touch, when overruled by the structure of large organizations? Creativity or processes ?Instead of creating more rigid processes, the development of major AAA games is calling for a revolution in the development process. Putting more human interactions at the core of game development is key. It's not just about agile development, it's about deliberately looking for ways to avoid size, automation and Taylorism from polluting the development process and resulting in creative failure."},

Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session, the speakers will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that they have encountered throughout their careers and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include training your team, building team culture, team morale, providing space to fail, structuring collaboration and using process to tell a story."},

As the result of this change, the Rare team has minimized crunch and has sustainably delivered new features to players. They've had over 100 retail releases so far which means they can learn from player feedback and evolve the game. The bug count has been very low throughout the project as they have invested heavily in automated tests, and consequently they've had a very small manual test team which has reduced cost significantly. Adopting continuous delivery practices isn't trivial; it will take a studio several years. Rare is continuously working to improve their capabilities, so this session will discuss the challenges they've faced and the principles behind the techniques and practices they've used. Some of the challenges include:How to work on a single branch (Trunk based development). How to continuously improve the commit stage. How to change studio culture to adopt automated testing. And finally, how to deal with flaky tests and identify the most relevant and valuable tests."},

So far, despite their small size, these cells have launched 4 games that have each been in the Top 10 charts for years during their lifetimes. In this session, Supercell's CEO Ilkka Paananen will dig into the lessons he's learned as a founder, sharing his experience from building Supercell, a company that has been structured in a fundamentally different way. After years of leading companies that were structured like most games companies, with management owning the vision and having creative control, he came to realize that games are a form of art, created by talented, creative people and that games businesses need to be structured in a way that allows them to flourish. Supercell turned the traditional top-down org chart upside down, giving the games teams the independence and full autonomy to design games, lead projects and have the final say on whether Supercell launches or kills a game.\r\n        "},

At the same time, there is also a pretty big need for more audio programmers in the game industry. So, what do you do? Learn. Composers and programmers are all here, and maybe have interests in both fields to some extent. So come take advantage of these interests and learn from one another to make game audio the best ever.Adding Punch to Your Sound (Gina Zdanowicz, Serial Lab Studios)This session will be booming as Gina Zdanowicz explores effect plug-ins, layering and editing techniques for creative sound design and music with a punch. Audio directors and game producers are always looking for bigger sounds that stand out in the mix or make a trailer feel charged. Join Gina as she shares techniques she learned working in the field to satisfy those demands. She will get up close and personal with tools like tremolo to move sounds, transient designers to sharpen the attack and add more punch, automation for more control and more.\r\n        "},
