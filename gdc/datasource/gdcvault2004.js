What would happen if commercial constraints were remove from the game design process? What if developers were free to create games that were radically experimental? How would designers react if they were confronted with some of the great unsolved game design problems? In the Game Design Challenge, you get to see how game design veterans answer these quesitons. A few months before the GDC, the panelists in the Game Design Challenge were given a design problem: come up with a concept for a game that tells a love story. At the Game Design Challenge session, they each present their solution. Each love story game concept offers a very different approach to this particular game design challenge, and each has been conceived for different gaming platforms. In addition to presenting the game concepts, the panelists are able to critique each others' work and the audience is also encouraged to join in on the critical discussion as well. More than just a design exercise, the Game Design Challenge asks expert game designers to think on their feet as they address important game design problems. Their answers to the challenge just might contain the seeds of gaming's future. Expect an unpredictable session of innovative and unusual game design ideas along with free-wheeling dialogue and debate."},

There are many ways to try and take advantages of the hardware at hand, but ultimately the final battle versus these limitations that take place during the implementation of Levels, specifically NPC and Object placement and management. The lecture touches lightly on some of the Design Philosophies utilized during the development of the console Medal of Honor titles. The title \"Four at a Time\" refers to the amount of NPCs that could be active at one time in original PlayStation version of Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Underground. The limitations were so extreme this talk is tailored towards those tools, trials and workarounds and specific techniques. Also, the lecture illustrates the transition to the PS2 and how that affected our approach. The goal of the lecture is to be able to takeaway techniques that you can apply in your own projects, regardless of genre, and at least a new way of looking at the problems and solutions fo some of the limitations put on NPC and Object placement. Interactive worlds are becoming increasingly complex with some of these techniques you should be able to turn technology imitations into strengths both for the end product and implementation methodologies."},

Well, nothing is impossible, and today, the landscape of Japan's videogame market is very different from what it was a few years ago, when those generalizations were formed. This discussion builds on the speaker's session last year about how to make your game successful in Japan, and focuses on answering many of the questions the previous session raised about the precise nature of the Japanese videogame market. The topics of discussion include an overview and update of the market, retreating and developing trends, the changing shape of gaming, following the Yen to mobile content, abandoning the negative image of non- Japanese games, high sales of US and European developed, titles such as Medal of Honor and GTA3, introduction of the \"CERO\" rating system, and looking forward to more mature videogames."}

The official Counter-Strike bot has received an enthusiastic reception from both newbies and veterans of the Counter-Strike community, largely due to the fact that it plays the game in a very believable, human-like fashion. The bots put on a \"performance\" that results in players feeling they are fighting against (and with) \"worthwhile\" opponents. Achieving this level of suspension of disbelief requires more than technical AI coding ability. It requires a thorough understanding of the game, insight into human limitations such as reaction times and attention prioritization, and a holistic sense of how to create a fun and believable \"performance\" from these disparate parts."},
