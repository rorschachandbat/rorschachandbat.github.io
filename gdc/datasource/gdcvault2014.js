This acceptance of the power of games matters, but more could be done, and strategic actions and investments could make a real difference in how games evolve, from the cultural level through the technical level. We believe that dialogue with the GDC community is a smart way to gather ideas and feedback to shape future federal-level actions around games. Speakers from two federal agencies will present specific examples of their investments in games, together with selected recommendations from the Media Systems gathering convened by three federal agencies and Microsoft. This will set the stage for ideas, responses and questions from the GDC community, both during the panel's discussion period and afterward."},

Modern smartphones have powerful and sophisticated technologies to specifically facilitate their use by those with vision impairments. These technologies, and others, are actually very simple and straightforward for developers to work with, making it increasingly easy to accommodate those with vision impairments or even target them directly.

This session will discuss vision related accessibility in gaming, ranging from what there is to gain from it, creative gameplay issues, as well as technical and business challenges and rewards. Also presenting is blind video gamer and advocate, Brandon Cole, for his unique insight into gaming as a person with a visual impairment, and as a beginning hobbyist game developer."},

Best practice guidelines are in place, studios from the largest AAA to the smallest indie are publicizing their efforts, support from fellow gamers is at an all-time high, and trade and government bodies are investing in raising awareness. But we're not in the Promised Land yet, and although there are huge benefits, there are also some common pitfalls. This talk shares experiences from both ends of the spectrum, lessons learned from when it hasn't gone well, and examples of success stories - both human benefit stories and examples of business cases. The talk goes beyond basics to give some real insight into how and why to broaden your game's audience to include gamers with disabilities."},

Between 20-25% of adults in America are estimated to suffer from some form of emotional ailment. And in our experience, the video game industry is susceptible to even higher rates of emotional distress due to the unique nature of the industry itself, those who are attracted to it, and the cultures which game developers function within. Considering the fact that we spend roughly one third of our lives at our place of employment (and in the games industry, this figure is often higher), ensuring the workplace can be a positive environment for those suffering from emotional distress is critical. Many emotional ailments can worsen in the workplace, and if left untreated, can result in tragic outcomes. The cost to companies themselves should also not be overlooked. According to a Harvard Medical School study, depression alone accounts for approximately 28 lost workdays per employee, at a cost of billions of dollars in productivity. This one hour lecture will empower developers to take positive steps to improve the quality of their workplace experience, and provide managers and CEOs with perspective on implementing larger programs to foster greater mental wellness at the studio level.\r\n        "},

While it is true that everyone working on a game must be in harmony to make the best game possible, never is this more the case than with design and engineering. They specifically must have a close relationship because of the iterative nature of gameplay creation both in design and implementation. However, the people involved in these two disciplines are intractably and largely different. This session will discuss a number of difficulties in crossing this border, and solutions for doing so. It will address ways in which the designer can gain a better understanding of engineering motivations, and as such have clearer communication and more productive work. It will also address the new hybrid appearing in the field, the technical designer, and how it is a necessary bridge for game work, but how it is also very rife with pitfalls if not handled well (green programmer issues, \"programmer\" not reporting to the engineering department, rogue check-ins in the name of fun, hacks, etc.). The talk will address the overall goal of unity with these two groups and how this can be achieved by thinking ahead of time, prioritizing the iterative work that needs to happen and creating workable pipelines for this work to happen in, and by trusting each other now that the boundaries separating them are gone through better understanding."},

However, the strengths of interactive media are player participation, the ability to experience content in different ways on different playthroughs and the fact that the content is not static. It's time for narrative to deeply embrace these elements. The challenge lies in building non-linear, replayable (narrative) sequences. By breaking narrative down to its smallest yet non-abstract elements and finding ways to combine and recombine them, one could potentially build a nearly infinite array of narrative opportunities out of these small building blocks. The comparison is closest to, say, the Death Star play set of our childhood, which was very specific and beautiful, but single-purposed versus Legos. Which on their own seem less exciting and less appealing, but can be recombined and repurposed in an infinite number of ways. It's time to start exploring narrative Legos."},

But having realistic perception and behavior is not enough, players need clear feedback to understand the model and the current state of the AI.

Okay, we do partially agree with this statement, but in fact, a far more useful strategy when launching a new product is to ignore them. The main idea here is that users that who spent their time giving you feedback generally like your product. On the other hand, customers dissatisfied with your product probably won't bother you with feedback, and are thus are hard to reach. In this case, your user sample as well as your decisions are biased. This is called survivorship bias. Survivorship bias can emerge in many ways, leading to harmful decisions. However, being aware of it and analyzing appropriate data can significantly advance the quality of your decisions and lead your product to success.

Each playthrough features a randomized chapter sequence, the narrative is based on dynamic character relationships instead of an event-based plot, and the player draws on their own values to take an active role as the author of the story. The goal was to make a game without a predetermined message, a game where each player would find their own meaning. But when designer Kent Hudson removed his personal biases from the narrative content he realized that he had in fact only shifted his area of authorship: the rules governing the characters' relationships and shaping their stories began producing unexpected outcomes. The systems had become the message, and shaping those systems became fundamental to the meaning of the game. This presentation chronicles the surprises, course corrections and fundamental shifts that occurred in pursuit of The Novelist's goals.\r\n        "},

Ubisoft's Patrick Redding argues that for a game experience to be meaningful, players should suffer occasional setbacks - situations in which the game requires them to shift their immediate goal in order to continue and succeed. In this session, Redding (Far Cry 2, Splinter Cell Blacklist) explores the conditions that permit setbacks to develop systemically and examines several design strategies that encourage them without provoking players into reloading a saved game. Redding looks at the unique challenge of fostering recoverable setbacks in stealth games, which at their best lets players play a tense cat-and-mouse game with a formidable AI; but which at their worst can degenerate into brittle guesswork with little room for experimentation or error.\r\n        "},

Having worked successfully with traditional publishers for our previous console titles, we decided to experiment with a different approach. Don't Starve is an uncompromising survival game, whereby players are thrown into the wilderness and left to fend for themselves, without any instruction. Through a rapid development process that was tightly bound to community building, Don't Starve went from a 16-hour game jam to a million-unit success. This talk recounts the game's development, from its concept to eventual success, describing its unlikely rise, and sharing both learnings and data around community engagement.\r\n        "},

It doesn't deal with the quality of experience, or the emotional and bodily aspects thereof.  This talk gives a clear and straightforward outline of the basic layers of player experience. It starts with a brief overview of what attention is and how it functions. It then moves on to explain the nature of higher-order processes that follow directing one's attention to a game, by describing player involvement through a model Gordon has developed over several years of qualitative research.

Social value is the extra spending generated when players cause each other to play and spend more (or less). It's measurable, and can be acted on. Players with a lot of this value are \"social whales\" who cause a ripple effect out on to other players. Measuring and harnessing that value has big implications for smarter user acquisition, monetization and retention strategies. Dmitri Williams describes the concept, the mechanics of player-to-player right data, methods for deriving scores, and case studies of the scores in action."},

Come find out how games such as Candy Crush Saga, Minecraft and Jetpack Joyride go beyond emotions like fiero and schadenfreude to motivate players to convert. Starting with new XEODesign research of the top grossing free-to-play games, together we dive deep into the world of player emotion to explore why players pay for lollipop hammers and custom G-suits. This diagnostic approach to sculpt emotional responses can improve conversion as early as the design document. Emotions are more than rewards for a job well done.

Over a decade later, we were challenged to create another revolutionary game. Our idea was to first build Landmark, a game and creative tool rolled into one. This game would enable gamers everywhere to create and share their own game content. These same tools would also be used to create content for the future release of another game, EverQuest Next. No one had embraced player-generated content in this way before, so the first hurdle was answering the question, \"how do we start?\" Senior art director Rosie Rappaport will step you through the iterative process of creating the first EverQuest Next Landmark prototype and its tools from concept to completion. Attendees will see the step-by-step process and philosophies unfold, and walk away with inspiration for prototyping their own unique ideas, in their own way."},

The primary difficulty with facial animation is balancing the trade-off between quality and volume, and the speaker has independently funded a project to address it. Traditional approaches such as motion capture with hand-sculpted blendshapes lose the fine subtleties of the face, whereas more extensive data capture processes (such as Universal Capture) are too expensive and do not fit game production requirements. To bridge this gap, the speaker has created a pipeline to drive facial animation using scans and motion capture. This session will walk you through the pipeline of taking raw scans, processing them into aligned blendshapes, compressing them to run in real-time, driving them with motion capture data, and then rendering them efficiently - the result being high-quality facial animation at moderate cost."},

Within this presentation, Keith will walk the audience through the artistic considerations of creating a compelling, dramatic sky to cast as a backdrop for their artwork. More importantly, he'll introduce the production challenges of skies within The Last of Us, and teach the audience how we were able to use vector fields, flow and some simple math to imply the motion of clouds receding into the horizon on a single matte painting, without losing our fast iteration."},

For a racing series like Forza Motorsport, artists must create the authentic and minute details of real-life and fictional environments. It all starts with how that reference is captured.

Instead of trying to craft gameplay that directly provides an engaging narrative, this approach allows one to solve the problem incrementally. The idea is to build a gameplay sequence by using layers of story elements. One starts by making sure the gameplay works and then adds narrative aspects afterward. Approaching the design in this manner allows for a much denser narrative experience. The end result is the sensation of playing a story, rather than progressing through a series of gameplay sections."},

Today, our Montreal-based studio, Minority Media, is dedicated to developing games that take players on a transformative journey by making them empathize through gameplay mechanics. What's more, other industry successes like Papers, Please and That Dragon, Cancer show that empathetic games are here to stay. At Minority, we continue to push this concept through our upcoming games by exploring bullying and traumatic love relationships. Our creative roadmap is lined with flags that guide us through the uncharted territory of empathetic games development. In this talk, I want to share some of these flags and help developers set their course through the complex and fascinating landscape of empathetic games.\r\n        "},

Engineers from Umbra Software and CD Projekt RED offer views from both sides as to how an engine and middleware should work together and their experiences in developing systems in collaboration. We will discuss and show the REDengine's various visibility-related features. Umbra's visibility system automatically generates occluders and removes the need for manual markup. The size of the world in The Witcher 3 makes using manually placed occluders impossible. Umbra was required to develop new streaming and an LOD system for its visibility software to meet the game's needs which we will discuss in our talk. The talk will contain information and examples of how Umbra was integrated into the engine's world editor and runtime, how it fits into the workflow and the performance budget, the challenges presented in creating a huge streaming open world game and an honest look in what went right and could be done better in the future."},

Pixel Sync is a hardware extensions available on Intel GPUs which ensures ordering of read-modify-write operations to the buffer. This new feature enables a wide range of new possibilities and in the technique it used to implement physically based lighting and high-performance rendering of clouds."},

Thanks to advances in modern graphics hardware, ray tracing is now a feasible technique for use in games. This presentation will describe how ray tracing has been successfully integrated into the Unity engine and combined with traditional rasterized 3D graphics. Accurate shadow rendering is a key component of visual realism. Ray traced shadows can provide good performance, accurate penumbra, and they avoid some of the artifacts and pitfalls of shadow maps and shadow volumes. Reflections are an obvious application for ray tracing in games. Reflections and refractions off irregularly shaped objects can add an element of realism that is difficult to achieve any other way. This session will cover the technical details of how these effects are blended into the Unity engine's rendering pipeline without sacrificing real time frame rate."},

For The Sims 4, we've developed a novel model for rendering high-fidelity synchronized behaviors involving multiple actors, even when driven by a simulation that runs at highly variable and/or low-frame rates, and which potentially communicates with the renderer over a high/variable latency connection. Historically, such products have often made significant compromises, either by requiring their simulations to run at real-time rates, and forcing extremely rigid synchronization, or by limiting visual quality in critical areas like character animation. Our solution addresses all of these, and is capable of scaling across a variety of game types by offering a core framework for individual game teams to extend and customize."},

For The Sims 4, we developed a system for authoring interactions that allows simulated people (called Sims) to express multiple concurrent behaviors. Interactions are largely data-driven and are defined in terms of constraints, which specify the state a Sim must be in to perform the interaction. Constraints are used to test whether interactions are compatible, and to drive decisions that Sims make about whether, how and where to perform an interaction. This system allows Sims in The Sims 4 to convincingly eat, watch TV, chat with other Sims, express emotion, and perform many more behaviors simultaneously. We believe that this powerful and simple technique could be applied to a similar effect in your game too."},

It provides a robust framework to facilitate experimentation with many aspects of the game in a controlled way and to confidently make decisions about positive changes to the game's design. The Bayesian approach to A/B testing, in comparison to the more traditional null hypothesis testing method, permits more dynamic analysis of the information as it arrives (i.e. differences in \"behavior\" of users subjected to the different variants in the test) and allows for real-time A/B testing and optimization of games. Using Bayes' rule, we can incorporate any prior information we have about the test and then constantly update our beliefs based on evidence we gain throughout the test. This allows us to make value judgments as the test is ongoing, weighing up the risk of a particular option to the potential gain, in support of or in contrast to our own intuition."},

Just as in game design, it is often what we choose not to do that will define our success. Key lesson learned: the current (and much discussed) tension in freemium game services between \"creative\" and \"business,\" is a false dilemma. Creating long-term engagements with your players through quality and fun - even at the cost of short-term revenue - can probably lead to greater success.

A formula that has become commonplace, but that potentially threatens those who do not truly understand it. The mantra is that you can simply take the Lifetime Value of a player (LTV) and subtract the cost-per-install (CPI), and when LTV is greater than CPI, you'll win. Based on Disruptor Beam's experience with Game of Thrones Ascent, Jon Radoff explains why this is not a surefire outlook toward mobile business models, clarifying basic principles surrounding LTV, CPI and ROI, while emphasizing the importance of attracting organic, loyal players."},

Massive structural changes in the way games are created, distributed and consumed have eliminated the traditional choke-points that empowered publishers: scarce shelf space, expensive manufacturing of packaged goods, access to development money, and conventional media marketing. As a developer, it has never been easier to get a game to market by yourself. So, is publishing dead? In this session, game industry-veteran and leading venture capitalist Mitch Lasky will dig into the pros and cons of the competing next-generation publishing models: the super-developers, the ad networks, the platform players, the social/chat networks and others. Lasky's thesis is that industry changes have not eliminated the profound economic benefit of scale, and that scale is the key to value creation. He will explore these different approaches, untangling the core components of modern publishing: audience aggregation, customer acquisition leverage, engagement and monetization, electronic distribution, and hardware/software platforms."},

In this GDC session, Ben Liu will give key insights into how Pocket Gems has taken inspiration from classic core games and introduced hardcore game mechanics to players who were initially drawn to casual games. Ben will explain the strategic rationale for decisions that led to the development of player versus player battles and crafting in Tap Paradise Cove, resulting in a two-year run on the top grossing charts. These mechanics evolved over time, as players became more and more excited by the new features. Ben will walk through how the new features were introduced, how they have improved, and also offer key takeaways for developers looking to run a successful, long-term mobile game.\r\n        "},

And with the Chinese government loosening rules around publishing games in China, is self-publishing now a viable strategy for Western companies? In this lecture, FunPlus CSO Dan Fiden will provide an overview of the Chinese mobile gaming ecosystem. He'll cover the relevant distribution points, publishing partners and handsets. He'll discuss what deal structures to expect from the various app stores as well as the local publishers. And most importantly, he'll provide an overview of the most popular and successful games in China, with an analysis of their monetization and retention, and the game mechanics that drive their success.

It can help with atmosphere, make a level more interesting and less repetitive, and help set the mood. For that, we need some way to package sound with some intelligence, too. Not much, but enough to control the sound dynamics. Instead of a monolithic sound manager, Dragica used finite state machines to control sound sets to form intelligent sound bubbles. They are easy to place in a level or add to an object. It was especially easy in Unity with the use of prefabs, which the level designer can place where needed. Some parameters that are specific to this bubble can be set directly in Unity, like volume and size. Sound sets and parameters are defined in an XML and can be easily managed and refined. The talk is about the general principle of intelligent sound bubbles and is not Unity specific."},

We will demonstrate our implementation of these demands, which is a next-gen sound system that was designed to combine artistic freedom with high run-time performance. It should be interesting to both creative as well as technical minds who are looking for inspiration on what to expect from a modern sound design environment. To emphasize the performance advantage, we will show the point of view of both the sound designer and the programmer simultaneously. We will use examples starting with simple sounds and build up to increasingly more complex dynamic ones to illustrate the benefits of this unique approach."},

This lecture will show how these two ideas can effectively coincide, retaining the organic feel and fidelity of live performances, while allowing for a high degree of adaptive flexibility. A score that responds well to gameplay requires that its component parts (music phrases, instrument stems, samples, etc.) be mixed in the console, dynamically, as the game is played. Real-time effects, such as reverbs and delays, bring flexibility and cohesion to these mixes. This approach leads to the added bonus of mixing and arranging music within the context of the game itself, alongside the other audio elements. By describing the composition and recording process that leads to the score for Peggle 2, this talk will demonstrate how music can be integral to any game design."},

This 25-minute lecture will discuss some of the ways that collaboration and interaction between sound and the rest of the team can be greatly improved."},

It will also explore the relationship between 3D audio and real-time environment modelling.\r\n        "}

But sometimes, we return to our true \"smoke and mirrors\" roots and get away with implementing something that is truly simple and yet has profound effects on the end product. This can be something that is apparent to the player, something that is only visible to the other devs around us, or might be something that only lives under the hood - known only to us. The common thread is that it is something that makes us ask, \"why doesn't everyone do this?\" In a return of the number one session from last year's AI Summit, this will be a rapid-fire series of presenters sharing something they have discovered and used over the years. They have to be simple, because each person will only have a few minutes to make their case!"},

The talk will start with a brief description of the dynamically constructed, self-modifying behavior trees that were used to create Faade, as encapsulated in the character language ABL. This enabled rich, dynamic sequencing and parallel performance of character behavior. But only lower-level physical manipulation behavior was reusable - the higher-level social behavior, such as having arguments about specific topics, was specific to Facade. In a large three-year project, we are extending these techniques to create reusable social behavior that can be dynamically retargeted to new social situations in the context of a full-body Kinect-driven game experience. This new approach combines the social action retargeting of CiF (the architecture behind Prom Week) and the behavioral dynamism of ABL to create reusable, real-time social behaviors for first-person character interaction."},

As such, they often have their visions of how things are supposed to be. When it comes to AI, however, designers are sometimes reluctant to yield that game experience over to AI agents who are by design doing their own thing. This often leads to designers wanting to overly script behaviors rather than to sit back and let things happen. The final result of such constraint on the game characters can at times even do more harm than good.

Rather than being \"alive\" for merely seconds, they are engaged with the player for hours - and are often meant to be the focus. Complicating things further is when the companion is expected to be both leader and the follower, both dynamic and scripted, both the entertainer and the entertained. Architecting a system that handles all of these divergent needs can be daunting. This talk explains how these seemingly contradictory design goals of BioShock Infinite's companion character, Elizabeth, were solved by leveraging philosophies from other entertainment mediums, as well as one of Irrational's core design pillars. Using a detailed series of before-and-after videos, the talk will examine failures and successes in both design and implementation. It will also explain some of the techniques that can be used by other developers to improve their own companion AI characters.\r\n        "}
