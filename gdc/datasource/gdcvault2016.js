This manual markup is necessary for logical information that can't be inferred automatically, like attack types and defense stances.

Such parameterizations are chosen in order to have a simple and straightforward description of the admissible range of rotation. Quaternion space parameterization is notoriously unintuitive and often perceived as unfit for describing ranges of rotation. This talk will compare different techniques for enforcing rotational joint limits and discuss their merits for use in real-time IK and physics solvers. The audience will learn how to apply these techniques directly in quaternion space, thus avoiding the use of expensive trig functions required for conversions."},

Valve's Aperture Robot Repair VR experience that was shown at GDC 2015 required an NVIDIA 980 to maintain framerate, but this talk will use that same experience as an example of how we now adaptively scale fidelity to maintain 90 fps on an NVIDIA 680, a 4-year-old GPU. The end result is an engine that appears higher fidelity throughout the experience, a lower GPU min spec, increased art asset limits, and a system that allows developers to stop focusing on framerate and instead spend their time increasing the quality and performance of their renderer while consistently maintaining framerate."},

The most fundamental limitation that is almost universally imposed on a character's locomotion is to assume that a bounding circle describes the character's footprint in the pathfinding world. While this works well for humans and other bipedal upright creatures, it does not work for a quadruped character (e.g. a horse or dog) with an oblong footprint required to navigate an obstacle-rich environment with passages narrower than the character's length, but wider than its shoulder width. This lecture will explain a solution to this problem that does not require the use of more advanced motion planning algorithms or solving hard problems like \"the piano mover's problem\"."},

The perception of your AI will not mainly be shaped by its usual behavior, but by the times it deviates from the norm. Second, we will challenge the idea that \"ally AI should support the player.\" Instead we explain why ally AI should first and foremost serve the game.

Tom Clancy's The Division features a large number of NPCs with a wide range of complex behaviors. The designers needed to be able to manage the creation, editing and debugging of the NPC AI in an effective, understandable and efficient way. This lecture will show how this is made possible using the technology of the Snowdrop engine. This talk will include an introduction to how behavior trees are structured and how their logic works. Jonas will demonstrate how behaviors from the game are employed to illustrate the various tools and techniques used to author them and to manage the complexity as the number of those behaviors increases. Throughout the talk the positive effects of a shared tool used by both programmers and designers will be highlighted."},

One assumption that is fairly universal is that time moves forward and what is done cannot be undone. But what if that assumption is violated? How do you write an AI when the player can freely edit the timeline of actions? In this lecture, Marq Singer and Dr. Chris Hazard talk in detail about creating the AI for their upcoming game, Plosh: Time Bomb. The game turns fast-paced crate-and-bomb game mechanics into a strategic, turn-based game where the players (including the AI players) are allowed to make changes to their strategies at any point in time during their turn. They will share algorithms and heuristics for how they approached this problem, including how the AI determines when in a plan to make modifications, They will also introduce metaplanning techniques and their \"metaminmax\" algorithm."},

The game music has received broad critical acclaim for its singular, intense Gothic horror sound performed by large orchestra, choir, soloists, percussion and utilizing extended orchestral techniques. This lecture will examine the musical style and orchestral approaches in the score. We will discuss the dissonant harmony, the horror-inspired melodic gestures, the \"wall of sound\" approaches and the blood-curdling action music. We will show how the challenging choral writing and the extended orchestral techniques evoked the desperate, disease-plagued City of Yharnam. We will also discuss how the orchestration helped unify the \"sound\" and aesthetics while working with a multi-cultural creative team (three Japanese staff composers at From Software, and three US guest composers). Additionally, the lecture will examine the communication and logistical challenges inherent with teams based across three continents, and strategies to promote successful musical productions."},

Once processes are in place, the producer must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions.

When the guesswork around authoring surface attributes is removed and artists can set up a material once to be efficiently reused throughout a game, they can spend much more time focusing on the more creative (and fun!) aspects of texturing. Yet in order to take full advantage of a physically based approach and ensure that each material responds as desired to any lighting condition, it is necessary to author with an awareness of how light actually interacts with different surfaces. This talk provides an easily accessible introduction to the principles of lighting and energy conservation before exploring guidelines for authoring infallible surface attribute maps. We will demonstrate the principles discussed and highlight the effect decisions made at the material creation stage affect the final render."},

The talk will be exploring the use of infrastructure management tools such as WPKG, SaltStack, Puppet, and Ansible for the deployment of creative studio pipelines. These tools were originally developed in the field of Dev/Live Ops and we'll explore concrete examples of how to use them in a studio setting for content creation. By strictly defining inheritable states a computer can be in, you open the possibility of taking a computer out of a box and deploying an entire pipeline to it, anywhere in the world, that can evolve as your business needs change."},

This is a video-heavy talk that focuses on animation authoring and state blending for quadruped characters. These characters have unique foot sliding challenges and traditional solutions result in either poor fidelity motion or a bloated animator workload. Our speaker will illustrate techniques for effortlessly creating high quality quadruped locomotion without the need for transition animations.

Each character delivers a unique and seamless performance without the use of any transition animations between gaits.\r\n        "}

Environmental storytelling does a great job of hinting at lives past, but AI actors with systemic behaviors are the key to demonstrating the life of a level right in front of the player. The presence that these performers and their interactions lend to the experience help the player to believe in the world itself.

To stay true to backers' expectations, one of their early constraints was a classic six attribute spread - a constraint that doesn't always play well with different classes and character concepts. In the classic games, it was easy to build a non-viable character - even if the player didn't realize it until they were 10 hours deep. Conversely, in Pillars of Eternity, the team often deviated too far from convention for player tastes. This talk will explore the specific RPG mechanic as it was in the classic games, as they developed it through the Pillars of Eternity beta, and how they continued to use player feedback to tune it post-launch. The talk will also take a look back across the project as a whole to see how the design of attributes influenced other game systems and the player experience in the long run."},

Yet, as games mature as a medium and aim to explore more complex emotions in a narrative sense, there is untapped potential in using gameplay itself to take the player out of flow and instead deliberately invoke uncomfortable emotions. This talk will discuss techniques on how to create a more varied emotional palette in play experiences, and why it is important to do so in today's gaming landscape."},

It then layers on top the signature Affliction system and psychological stress mechanic. Figuring out how to smash all these pieces together and make the play experience cohesive and understandable was a juggling act with significant challenges. Making iterations on the fly during a live Early Access environment with a large community was also not without harrowing moments. This detailed post-mortem covers what went right from a design perspective and what didn't, using specific game examples. The discussion will be endcapped with a glimpse at what the future of Darkest Dungeon might be."},

Killer ARPU, great retention, a rabid community of evangelists, a great looking product and a multi-million dollar warchest from the recent financing had many industry pundits predicting that Space Ape's second game was guaranteed to be a Top 20 Grossing hit. When the dust settled on launch the critically acclaimed game emerged around Top 100 grossing - Top 50 on a good event day - which is a great success by any measure for an independent developer and something to be proud of, but did not exhibit the level of commercial success many in the industry were expecting. In this session, Space Ape founder and COO, Simon Hade, will share the research that led to some critical decisions he believes ultimately held the game back from fulfilling it's potential but also the lessons learned, especially around theme testing and positioning, as well as the key product and community tactics which have allowed the company to grow the game month on month with almost no marketing spend. In the process, he will provide an overview of the current landscape of the broader mid-core genre, game and marketing metrics and tactics that are important to launch a game in today's market."},

It seemed the mobile market was excited for a historical strategy game in the vein of Age of Empires and Civilization. Four months later the title had sunk far below the top-100 grossing and the studio contemplated a tightly constrained future for the game. The team had failed to launch with key drivers of retention and revenue, and spent most of 2015 scrambling to add those features. Brick-by-brick, and with the help of a great Asia launch, they managed to reverse the game's decline and ensure the future stability of the studio.\r\n        "}

From mistakenly sending confidential emails to different competitors, to being forced into driving across Canada overnight in an attempt to reach our PAX booth in time, the stories will range from amusing to head shaking.
