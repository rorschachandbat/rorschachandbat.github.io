You should come away knowing if this type of financing could work for you and your company, and how to improve your chances for success. ArtCraft Entertainment has done both a successful Kickstarter campaign and a successful Equity Crowdfunding campaign with Indiegogo's new Equity Crowdfunding service and their direct experience is being shared in this presentation. Regular people (non-accredited investors) have been prohibited from investing in small private companies but the 2012 Jobs Act changed that.

It is important to understand the expectations of players at each step in your development process, from beta to full release, and beyond. As well as finding a way to maintain those strong relationships that existed at each of those steps.

Or, Viking Enthusiasts. Or, whatever their game's \"nontraditional Steam gamer\" equivalent may be. In her lecture, Emmy Jonassen of independent video game publisher, Snow Cannon Games, will share how Viking Enthusiasts were identified as a strong market for its game, 'The Frostrune'. She will also share the campaign designed and executed to reach this market: A campaign that resonated so well, mead-drinking and axe-wielding folk who had never heard of 'The Frostrune' before, were responsible for the majority of its social sharing, thousands of visits to Steam and 60% of its Greenlight yes votes."},

One of Titanfall's signature moments is something we call \"rodeo\",where pilots can sneak up on a titan and jump onto their back. In 'Titanfall', this culminates in the pilot ripping off an access panel and shooting the exposed circuitry to deal heavy damage. In 'Titanfall 2' however, rodeo becomes a cat-and-mouse game of the pilot stealing a titan battery, taking a chunk of the titan's health, and the titan frantically hunting down the pilot to get the battery back. Join Respawn Entertainment on a guided tour of the development of rodeo, as they reveal early prototypes, mediate on the lessons learned, discuss the difficulties involved in making sure that both titan and pilot understand exactly what is happening during rodeo, and detail what convinced them of the necessity to make large, sweeping changes to rodeo for 'Titanfall 2'."},

However, the current status quo in mobile game development utilizes engines like Unity3D which do not have native support for similar workflows. This results in a more error-prone and redundant user interface development workflow, where artists create a user interface remotely and developers have to mimic it in the engine. This talk shows how to apply modern development architectures to Unity3D, allowing developers and artists to focus each on their expertise and still have the results align in harmony. By applying proven concepts, these modern developments allow each party to work independently while still being able to test their own work at all times."},

For Cozmo, Anki used real world physics so there was no \"cheating\", and they had to adjust their way of thinking about assets accordingly. This session presents an overview of the asset pipeline on Cozmo, a complex, physical, game-playing robot, with over 300 parts, powered by a mobile app. This session will also describe the complexities of using data from Maya to transfer animation onto something with physical constraints. Molly and Daria from Anki will discuss the tools built for fast animator iteration, scripts for testing, debugging, how it eventually translates to physical movement and other workflow improvements throughout the development cycle. They will review the process for streaming audio and animation data to the robot and when programmatic corrections were required."},

The presentation layer uses Unity graphics and input, but is fully decoupled from the game simulation, which runs on a separate C# thread. Deterministic simulation keeps multiplayer synchronized, as game state changes only in response to low bandwidth command inputs that are shared across the network. Audiovisual presentation reacts to events and state changes output by the simulation. Vehicles are simulated in 2D using fixed point math and augmented with \"aesthetic physics\" in the 3D presentation layer. Large desert environments are authored as sculpted meshes painted with a multi-layered deferred decal system. Off-the-shelf and custom particle systems, shaders, post-effects and lighting are combined to achieve uniquely stylized visuals. Performance was optimized with a cache-friendly entity system, robust LOD techniques, and various extreme measures to avoid C# garbage collection."},

In the spirit of that accomplishment, he decided to keep working on porting this structure into a game engine using as minimal equipment and paid software as possible. Scanning a huge structure can be quite challenging, but getting the scan into a game engine was even harder. There are particular challenges that comes to working with scans of huge structures, and his talk will cover the latest photogrammetry techniques that enables you to create game ready assets, the challenges that come with working on huge structures, and it will cover the workarounds that can reduce the cost of such workflow."},

Blending multiple animations has traditionally been a way of dealing with distance, direction and environmental variance. However, the amount of assets needed for adequate coverage in today's large AAA titles can be crushing. Multiple animation blending also reduces visual freedom as blended animations must be of similar style and timing. Some games have tackled this content explosion by dynamically warping motion to meet the spatial constraints. These are often ad hoc/specific to particular actions and not exposed to the animator. For 'Gears of War 4', The Coalition developed a generalized solution by introducing the concept of warp points.\r\n        "},

Each speaker has ten minutes to go into detail about their rule and talk about how they've used it on past projects, highlighting where it works well and where it may not be applicable. For each rule, you can then decide whether it's useful for your own projects and how you might merge that technique into your own design rulebook. You may not agree with every rule you hear in this fast-paced and energetic session, but they'll certainly get you thinking about the craft of game design."},

At Naughty Dog, the praise and awards they\\'ve received are due to not only the methods they have for writing and recording those performances, but also the ways they seamlessly implement them, and later reconform them as the game evolves.

Drawing on design tool evaluation research, this talk introduces and gives an overview of some of the game design tools available today. As well as tools that can help with common tasks in level design, game system design and narrative design, you'll learn about experimental, AI-powered tools that can extend design possibilities using technologies like procedural content generation. You'll also hear frank assessments of the benefits and limitations of using these tools and how they might impact your design process, as well as concrete examples of design problems that these tools have helped solve and some of the ways designers have managed to incorporate tools into their design workflow."},

It is a hidden role, social deduction game which requires players to take on the roles of German parliamentarians in the 1930s Weimar Republic. The German government system is simulated in a very abstract way to create tension and suspicion as all players are aware that \"fascists\" have secretly infiltrated their ranks, but none of the \"liberal\" players know where the other players' loyalties lie. This design postmortem from 'Secret Hitler' co-designer Mike Boxleiter will go over the initial design process, pitfalls and dead ends which were avoided in the iteration process and the final marketing push on Kickstarter."},

Specific focuses include: How Ludeon Studios defined 'RimWorld' not as a game, but as a story generator, and how forcing themselves into this frame opened up entirely new mechanisms for creating compelling play. How, by strategically leaving out features, they made players engage with features and story elements that aren't actually there. How they made better decisions by not planning despite everyone wanting them to plan. And finally, how they shipped with many seemingly-critical features missing, but nobody cared, because they used a special methodology for selecting features that actually matter instead of the ones that commonly assumed to be necessary."},

Today's mainstream players want their games to have hundreds or even thousands of hours of gameplay, and they want to be the ones who direct that experience. As such, it is extremely valuable for developers to have a nuanced understanding of player autonomy, enabling them to satisfy players while avoiding common traps that lead down bad design roads. Chief among these traps is misunderstanding autonomy to mean \"giving players freedom,\" which often leads to player frustration and disappointment rather than satisfaction. This session will not only review such autonomy pitfalls, but will outline an accurate blueprint of what autonomy truly means, give examples of how leading contemporary designs optimize for autonomy, and discuss best practices and issues for the future.\r\n        "},

The tried and tested visual tricks you rely on in traditional games to draw the player's attention can feel clunky in VR; whilst a big arrow pointing at something works on a utilitarian level, it fights against the wonderful sense of presence. The resultant pressure being put on audio to help solve this problem is a brilliant opportunity, but it's not one most people have much experience with. Come to this talk to learn about the approach that worked brilliantly in Secret Sorcery's critically acclaimed VR debut, 'Tethered'."},

In doing so, it captures important effects like smooth occlusion around obstacles or longer reverberation in large halls, as well as how these effects change when source and listener move through the environment. Nikunj and John will discuss both the technical and design aspects of the system, providing details on its integration in Unreal Engine 4 and AudioKinetic Wwise.

While this provides many opportunities, it also provides many challenges. Where do you go next with such a hugely popular game? How do you modernize a timeless classic? How do you add meta game features without negatively impacting the existing audience? In this session, Russell will share experiences of changing the classic 'Solitaire' to increase revenue, engagement and retention. He'll talk about what the game's large, vocal and very change resistant audience has taught MobilityWare about how to safely add new features. He'll discuss how they use multiple sources of data to inform decisions, and production processes they've created to protect both their designers and their users while making regular updates."},

In this talk, 'Reigns' co-creator Francois Alliott explains how the team gave themselves a set of constraints defined by the gameplay they were exploring and the tone they wanted to give to the game. But these rules never dictated the writing of the game or the extent of what the game could be. Bifurcation and wandering were essential to write both the code and the content of 'Reigns' throughout the 6 months of its production. This sort of approach, although apparently messy and unstructured, is very powerful, especially for indies. Alliot believes that the industry is at the point where game development could almost be considered as accessible as writing, because the tools are less of an obstacle, and explains in this GDC talk how creators can use the same skills as novelists or poets: work by constant iteration on a design that evolves through the process of creating it."},

This session will describe the Hierarchical Portfolio Search AI system created by Lunarch Studios for their game, 'Prismata'. HPS is modular, robust, easily configurable, and can be built on top of a game's existing AI behavior library. David Churchill of Lunarch Studios will show how it can be adapted to fit almost any genre of game, including search-heavy ones like strategy games .

Project management methodologies and processes in the video game industry have been analyzed ad nauseum, often sold as production cure-alls. While these mechanics of game production are indeed important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: the emotional and nebulous portion of being a producer. In order to maintain the health of a project, producers must react to team dynamics, and adjust things on the fly. Once processes are in place, the producer must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session the speakers will investigate several facets of soft skills and share specific situations that they have encountered throughout their careers and how their soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games.

What does that mean for those working in games today? Don Daglow has held leadership positions on projects on every console generation from the first Atari-Intellivision \"console wars\" to today, and advises teams on every major modern hardware platform.

This interactive session will help you collaborate better by more candidly conducting difficult conversations. You will: reflect on how you relate to conflict, your organization's culture around conflict, and how conflict might be useful; experience how a healthy mix of assertion and cooperation leads to true collaboration; and learn how emotional intelligence can help anyone better navigate difficult conversations.
